    "body": "I’m a full-time software developer with a constantly growing list of pet projects and an increasing inability to actually get any work on done of them.\n\nAt this very moment I have ten repositories on BitBucket that mostly have just READMEs with notes describing what the project is about, though some have a bit of actual code as well. One of these projects stands some theoretical chance of being worthy of a startup some day, but they’re all mostly things I either have a use for or want to build to learn something.\n\nThe problem I have is something akin to paralysis of choice: I think about most of them here and there and sketch something out or jot down some notes, and sometimes even write some code, but I lose a fair bit of time I could spend being productive on deciding what to work on.\n\nThe net result is that I don’t get much of anything done, and it’s incredibly frustrating.\n\nI imagine there must be others who can relate, and I’d love to hear about how you’re dealing with this (and how successfully).",
