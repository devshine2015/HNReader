The journey, however passionate and committed you are, will have its ups and downs. Everyone might have a different way of relaxing at the end of the day. I listen to music - but I would love to laugh out to relax. I feel it's one of the more common ways anyone can relax by. I am trying to find books, comics and other things that make me laugh. (Avoiding online videos)\n\nI am curious about HN - where do you get your laugher quota everyday?",
