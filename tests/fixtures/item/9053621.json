      "body": "As I pointed out the previous three times this happened to a Bitcoin exchange, these operators seem to be totally clueless about basic bookkeeping and financial controls.  Consider a typical large supermarket. Cash, credit cards, coupons, and merchandise are being handled. There are multiple cashiers, usually more than one shift of staff, cash drawers, safes, cash pickups from an armored car service. That's a lot going on.If there's a $10 bill missing, it will noticed within hours.  Where it went will probably be figured out the same day.  If someone is stealing, management will usually find out  who, how much, and when.The Bitcoin crowd has a much simpler problem. They're all online, they don't have a staff of people handling money, and they don't have as many special cases as a supermarket does.  (Travelers checks, returns, check cashing, etc - Bitcoin exchanges don't have to deal with that.)  Most Bitcoin exchanges are doing a few transactions a minute. Bigger supermarkets do more than that. Yet the Bitcoin crowd consistently botches it.The Bitcoin crowd needs to get some people who have passed Internal Financial Controls 101 at a 2-year business college.[1]  This isn't rocket science.\n\n[1] http://www.georgiacenter.uga.edu/courses/governmental-traini...",

On the other hand, if there is a shared vulnerability, it may be in a commonly used library lower in the stack.There is one possible tangential relationship, however. As I've been researching the transactions, early indications point to a portion of the stolen BTC and NBT from Excoin being placed on BTER prior to BTER's announcement. If this is the case, the parties responsble for the Excoin theft may have inadvertently deposited their coins into an exchange that was subsequently pillaged...\n\n(Disclosure: I'm a member of the Nu development team, so Excoin's and BTER's exchange problems affect our community)",

I don't know off-hand of any exchanges that atomically isolate user funds and utilize the block chain to handle internal transaction reconsiliation. There's an off-shoot of block chain tech that is attempting to do atomic, cross-chain trading using the block chain, but it's still very new and experimental[1].>  Additionally bank accounts are federally insured.Up to a certain amount.

And that transaction is combined with another one of the form \"these ARE my ones and zeros\", and after a minimum number of copies of the global list has that information the transaction can be said to be complete.If the user were to attempt to reassert their ownership of the ones and zeros (they have all of the original data still) the global list which everyone else can see shows that have given up those ones and zeros in the past. And there is nothing the user can do to change the global list at that point. Its like the master tally stick was swapped out in the vault and their half no longer matches any part of it.\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick",

There's far too much of that on HN.)Bitcoin is an agreement by the worldwide blockchain that you personally control the fate of anywhere from 0 to 21 million bitcoins.  You can hoard them, send them to someone else, or throw away your access to them.  But you can control no more than 21 million coins, because there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.  See http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/161/how-many-bitc...I'm trying to figure out what you're saying.  It seems like if your arguments apply to Bitcoin, then they would also apply to any other kind of good with limited supply, such as gold.  Why would anyone be outraged when gold is stolen?  Because people believe gold has value.  The reason gold is valuable is due to its scarcity, not because gold is inherently valuable.  People rarely use gold for its unique conductivity properties, whereas they usually use it for its scarcity.  Same with Bitcoin.So if your arguments apply to Bitcoin and gold, then what is being said?  I'm curious to know your position on this.  Not because I'm trying to defend or prove anything, but because your ideas tend to be interesting.\n\nI think maybe people here are just talking past each other, so maybe it would help to articulate in detail?",
