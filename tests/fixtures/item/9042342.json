    "body": "I like different tools for different things, and I'm just as likely to write a bash (or python or perl) script if it's something quick, and javascript is growing on me as I do more front end work, but C is one of my favorite programming languages.\n\nI work free lance at the moment, and there is never really a great opportunity to work with C, except on my own personal projects, or occasionally contributing to open source.  I've been reviewing it for technical interviews, and enjoying the clarity of it.  Yes it's imperfect, but then so is javascript, and people built lots of stuff with javascript.\n\nAnyway it made me wonder, what companies in the Bay Area hire people to write in C?  A quick search through the who's hiring thread for this month shows... one.\n\nThere are 140 comments for companies in the sfbay area.  40 mention python. 28 mention ruby. 71 mention javascript.\n\nThat's fine.  I am a software engineer, not just a C programmer.  But I am curious if I'm missing any good ones in my job search where I could have a place.  There do seem to be occasional jobs for C programmers, but they seem to be for people who have 15+ years experience developing kernel modules, or a masters in EE.  I'm not sure how I can bootstrap that radically.",
