      "body": "Seems like HN could do well with an introduction to Arlie Hochschild and \"The Managed Heart\" http://www.amazon.com/The-Managed-Heart-Commercialization-Fe....Here's a bit of the blurb from Amazon:\"In private life, we try to induce or suppress love, envy, and anger through deep acting or \"emotion work,\" just as we manage our outer expressions of feeling through surface acting. In trying to bridge a gap between what we feel and what we \"ought\" to feel, we take guidance from \"feeling rules\" about what is owing to others in a given situation. Based on our private mutual understandings of feeling rules, we make a \"gift exchange\" of acts of emotion management. We bow to each other not simply from the waist, but from the heart.\n\nBut what occurs when emotion work, feeling rules, and the gift of exchange are introduced into the public world of work? In search of the answer, Arlie Russell Hochschild closely examines two groups of public-contact workers: flight attendants and bill collectors. The flight attendant’s job is to deliver a service and create further demand for it, to enhance the status of the customer and be \"nicer than natural.\" The bill collector’s job is to collect on the service, and if necessary, to deflate the status of the customer by being \"nastier than natural.\" Between these extremes, roughly one-third of American men and one-half of American women hold jobs that call for substantial emotional labor. In many of these jobs, they are trained to accept feeling rules and techniques of emotion management that serve the company’s commercial purpose.\"",

Central Europeans, including Czechs are a rather gloomy bunch :-) especially in the winter. Americans are definitely more cheerful, and it is not fake. Ok, sometimes it is but generally speaking Americans are in fact more cheerful and optimistic. Ok, Czechs have five centuries of being conquered and subjugated of course, so let's not draw too many conclusions.\n\nIn terms of smiling strangers, well, I'd like a bit more of it than we have here in the Czech Republic (where there is very little)",

At the same time, I feel everybody I meet there is a clown and I always make sure to tune down their enthusiasm. If an American says something is super awesome and the best thing ever, it's probably kinda okayish.Anyway, the interesting thing I've found comparing Slavs to Americans is that while Slavs are weary of strangers, they open up much sooner. You can be friends with Americans for months and years, but if you haven't gone to the same kindergarten together, you will never be a true friend. Whereas with Slavs, you could have met at a bar three hours ago, and already you're confessing your deepest darkest secrets to each other and are practically best friends.Source: having lived in the States for some time\n\nPS: to be fair, most Europeans I've met both in Europe and in the US share this immediately friends trait.

The article could be about \"bitchy resting face\" or tipping, or any other form of compelled social niceity and it could delve into the same topics.People see certain social cues, and they interpret them based on past experience.  People who smile at you, and talk in a certain frequency range, and use certain words, must be nice and want to help you.  Anyone who owns a business wants all customers to feel that emotion whenever they associate with your business, and implicit social contracts evolve that basically codify that.It's like \"The Game\" in some respects.   There are certain social cues / responses that most people have internalized so deeply that they're barely aware they respond to them.  Most people interpret offhand compliments from a person with apparent detatched interest as intriguing.  They interpret questions about them as interest.  Easy smiles as confidence.  Ect...With the aforementioned tipping, it's a similar mechanism that reinforces certain behavior in wait staff.  In a sense, it's a way that those with money can compel behavior from those that don't.  An aspect of the symbolic power that wealth effectively represents.\n\nAnyhow, lunch arrived, so I'm done, and I'll have to make that very choice in a few moments.",

As I understand it, the unemployment rate that is typically reported excludes people that have given up looking for work.I don't know if this is correct, but let's say that you had an economy where there were no jobs available. Precisely none. Over the long term, the unemployment rate would have to drift down to almost zero, as more and more people realized that there were no jobs available and gave up looking for work.As regards the sentence you ask about, I think I am one of the people that does not look at his work as merely a job. Perhaps it's because I do try to distinguish between my work, my craft, my trade, from the other aspects of who happens to be paying my invoices.\n\nThoughts?",

So I get to travel to a lot of places, work in a lot of organizations, and \"start over\" with each new gig.A few years ago I thought I would try something different. I decided that no matter how I felt each day, I was going to smile and be as friendly as possible to everybody I met. At times, walking through the hallways of the new job, I felt like an idiot. But I didn't care. I just smiled and tried to be friendly.I know that many times I probably smiled and said hello to the same people twice -- as if I had never seen them that day. I know that at times I must have appeared simple-minded. It was a horrible feeling that first week.Then something strange happened. People started smiling back. I would be working off to the side of a large room, and folks would come over and say hello. People -- I had no idea what their names were or what their jobs were -- would ask me how I was doing.So I kept the experiment going. After a month, I had some really bad personal news and I know I came in to work very downtrodden. At this point, all of that \"fake happiness\" I had put in the bank came back to me. The anonymous people I had smiled at? They now made an effort to cheer me up. No effort was required on my part. If I came in upset, within a couple of hours of having other people smile at me, I felt like smiling back at everybody else.This went on for a few months. It was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever had, and when I left, about a dozen people came over and told me that I had done a great job and they would miss me. (I just did my normal job)\n\nLesson? Smiles are very, very powerful social tools, even if they are forced. They cheer other people up, they cheer you up, and over time they provide some kind of weird social insurance that you can tap into when you're having a bad day. What blew my mind was that the fake part wasn't even important. Simply by trying you got all of the benefits.",

This is not a symptom you only see in the US.  It's saccharine in many places.  That said, saccharine or not, it does have a purpose as much as any other line of questioning.  In other words, passion, love, whatever, while they may or may not be an indicator of how well someone will execute their job --the main purpose of such questions, in my mind, is to see how well prepared you are for something you can expect.In other words, it's not that they expect a sincere answer or they are trying to torture you and see how you wiggle yourself out, but it's rather to gauge how adept you are at preparation.  You know the questions is coming, yet, did you take the preparation to come up with a sensible answer.  That is the function of the question.On the other hand, if we were to take these questions literally, yes, then they are quite silly expectations.  I have had them at just about every professional job and they are absurd.  But we know it's all part of meta-communication.  Do I wish it were simpler and didn't recourse to this style of communication, yes, but I think I understand its function.On the other hand, I do enjoy people regarding their job as an act.  A role to fulfill. When we understand our jobs to be essentially a role to fulfill, it's liberating in a way.  It's no longer you, it's your job personae.  Compare service workers in Japan and Europe.  Which ones deal with their situation better?  I believe the Japanese worker has a better understanding of the situation.  They put on their persona and take it from there.  To see it any other way is to see an actor performing a dark character and feeling bad for the actor.  No, to the actor it makes no difference.  It's an act.\n\nThat said, I've come across very good service workers in Europe as well.  They very well understood their function and were happy to play it out.",
