      "body": "Our actual job is working on SD Elements (http://securitycompass.com/sdelements/). Let's Chat is just a side project, but it's also something we use internally everyday. The features you wish were there we also wish were there, no doubt. Lots of the developers here like working on it. I expect there will be updates from us for the foreseeable future. Hopefully we'll start getting more external pull requests as well.\n\nI doubt we are going to pivot to a free chat client company any time soon.",
