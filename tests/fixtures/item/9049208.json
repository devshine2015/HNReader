Having a group that is moving in the same direction helps create social pressure, and social pressure makes wonders.\n\n2) Create a finish line and a deadline. They may be fictional, but they must be there. For technical subjects, an applied project is excellent. Say, if you are studying networking, try your hand at writing a protocol analyzer, or a SyncThing client. It must require the theoretical knowledge you are hoping to gain. If you can couple this with strategy (1), some amazing stuff comes out (I always remember fondly a Petri Net state machine compiler I built with four friends in three days flat).",

It suggests that absolute addiction is not really as hard to overcome as we previously thought.  The problem with addiction is it's a way to bond with something.  Bonding is the actual addiction.  You can bond with people, drugs, things, behaviors.  If you want to overcome a particular addictive pattern of behavior, you bond with something else and you will overcome it.\n\nBack to your problem.  I think we all develop addictive patterns of behavior.  One of those patterns is absorbing new possibilities.  Learning what's possible.  But never acting on it.  It's a side effect of having access to all this information.  I suggest you bond with one particular idea.  Do this by bonding with the people who are already bonded with the idea.  Focus on one thing.  I don't think it actually matters what it is as long as it's in line with your learning/career goals.  Locate blogs and other people on campus with a strong bond to the idea you are trying to master.  Embed yourself in with these people.  Get to know them.  Believe in what they preach.  Absorb the information until you reach a level of mastery that appeals to you.  Then leave and do it again with a new idea.  You have to become a true follower and believer of the particular scripture you are chasing down.  Once you do that, your mind will open up and allow you to absorb as much knowledge as you have time for.",

Even if learning just meant leafing though the books.  Similar to a graduate student getting degrees to avoid real life (in some not all cases I mean) and the real world.\n\nI broke the habit by deciding that I didn't need another book and I should spend the time actually using the knowledge that I had acquired. Not that these were all computer books (they weren't) but an example would be to actually sit down with that book on PHP or Mysql and actually start to do something (was a LAMP book iirc). I did that one day and built a tool that I could use that was really valuable. I forced myself to read from the start. Now I question each thing I think about learning in terms of the actual value and whether I should concentrate on things that I have already acquired knowledge wise.",

I found this kind of baffling: why waste your time reading pages and pages.. rather than waste a perfectly good hour, you can start working on the problem, then figure out exactly what you're missing, filling in along the way.  And that's all you're ever going to be doing, filling in skill sets little by little.  Choose your battles; John Carmack ain't no React.js expert.",

It's difficult to say because of the details you omitted, but whatever it is you're trying to do is probably the wrong thing. If you need to cover 4 highly technical subjects in 4 months, then you've made a wrong turn somewhere and you need to stop and re-evaluate things. No matter how important it seems, no matter how alluring the opportunity. It just isn't going to happen. If this is a life or death situation then get your affairs in order, because the odds of anyone being able to learn effectively in that context are extremely low.If you want to learn one or maybe two of those things then pick a practical project. Learning Algorithms from a MOOC is a good start, but you might want to augment that by implementing some of them in an open source library using a language of your choice and putting it on github. You'll learn by doing, you'll hopefully get feedback and you'll have the pressure of doing it publicly. Practical experience is one of the best ways to learn, if not the best. Then repeat some variant of that process for the other things that you feel you need to know. Find a public and real world application and let it light a fire under you.\n\nBest of luck, Michael.",

You sound like a conscientious student who's interested in your subject; I'd say simply enjoy life, enjoy your friends, enjoy your mental life and don't beat yourself up about it - like you say there's a lot of information out there in our field, it'll come in time and you'll find your niche.

Unfortunately I still feel that I am missing out because I chose business over engineering (which I continue to regret).I'm just 1.5 years away from being 30 so I realize that I have quite a long time left in my software development career to catch-up to all you CS people. I don't think I've been undirected (the opposite of conscientiousness) but I've been misdirected and distracted. I've studied other things including web design and music production. I've also enjoyed life a lot (and slacked off by watching too much Adult Swim and Comedy Central, as well!).\n\nIt's hard being productive and studious all the time. While some people work 80 hour weeks continuously, most people don't out of need for sleep, exercise and relaxation. There is certainly an ebb-and-flow to this so I am embracing the idea that it will take me many more years of continuous growth and effort to get where I want to be. I also know that I need to eliminate as many distractions as possible, including turning off the TV and avoiding going out to concerts, clubs and bars. I have picked up some meditation techniques as well (including spending 10 minutes a day, at least once a day, focusing on deep breathing in order to unwind my frontal cortex).

When you're motivated, things tend to fall into place.That's not an indictment of you. Contrary to popular belief, motivation doesn't much come from within. For almost everybody, long-term motivation is about other people: your friends, your community, and the world at large. You'll be motivated to do something when these groups of people push you to.And the mechanism for that push is almost always the same: status. In the long term, human beings find it very easy to do things that increase their status, and very difficult to do anything else (except for things that are inherently more pleasurable than difficult — but that generally doesn't include studying CS theory).This is really hard on college students, because even though good grades will increase your status after college, they rarely do much for your status in college. If you're good, professors might care, but the collective student body won't.The solution is to find people who really care about your performance in your field of study — maybe a professor's lab, maybe a group of high achievers, maybe (ideally) a club with an external goal (e.g. autonomous vehicle club) — and make those people central to your life by spending a lot of time with them. If you do, it'll become natural for you to work hard at your field. Although still, you'll only be driven to do things that directly increase your status in your group.\n\nAnd of course, this solution can be hard to implement; spending lots of time with a new group of people takes its own motivation. It gets a lot easier after college, though. After college you get a job, and wherever you work, everybody will care about how you perform.",

That kind of focus can elliviate the desire to jump from one shiny thing to the next.\"Zen mind, beginner's mind\" is a small, wonderful book on the basics of zazen -- the art of sitting quietly, without thoughts.\n\nGetting started is easy: take easy, natural breaths, counting them until you get to ten. As thoughts enter your mind, acknowledge them and return focus to your breathing.",

Im a self employed technology Consultant who deals with everything from desktop support, Office IT consulting, security systems, Home theater systems, web site design, and much more, with a lot of experience in the field. I have the same problem though, every month and sometimes every week, im on a new adventure. One week I want to actually get an MCSE, no but wait Linux is going to take over the world, let me study linux more, no wait everything is going to be scripted, lets study python, oh but wait all those jobs are moving to india, you have to be in UX where there is more creativity, man Im bored with this, I want to study cryptography which is way more interesting, Cryptography is fun, but do you really see yourself in the crypto field, finance is fun too and you can make a shit ton of money on your own, etc etc  -And It's a cycle, Ill be back to square one in a years time or so. As far as how I deal with it, well, I already have a career, it being my own business, so I'm not really needing to pass any exam or anything, I kind of do all that stuff for fun and I do enjoy it. But it is frustrating not being able to stick to one thing really. I think the key is to push through the boring, frustrating parts. When you hit the lows in fun and interesting, you have to keep pushing through. I know it's harder than it sounds. A couple of suggestions would be try getting a partner that you can study with. I know it doesnt work for everyone but its a thought. Also, maybe learning through an actual project might get you to stick through it.\n\nGood luck",

For example, if I am learning about compilers, I will think of a programming language and write a compiler for it.

In my personal projects, I would keep experimenting with different languages, frameworks , libraries, patterns etc. and they would all end as an unfinised github project waiting to be deleted. Whereas in projects done at workplace or as freelancer, the technology stack is fixed and you limit yourself experimenting with too many libraries. At the end of the project there is learning and a finised product to be proud of. Not impliying here that personal projects should not be done, but too much experimenting increases the chances that the project wont go to production. Therefore along with speed, have a direction to reach the goal.\n\nTip: Unsubscribe from forms on technologies you do not use to avoid distraction.",

So first of all: Don't worry!From my experience what you can do is prioritize the stuff you have to do in chunks. Use something like the Promodoro-technique (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to focus on the things you are doing. Don't do anything else but exactly what you want to learn in that moment. Try to track your progress by making little tutorials, summaries, videos for yourself and others.From my experience more than anything else it takes discipline with yourself and also the understanding that you don't have to know everything in the world right here and right know. You can be rest assured that nobody does.\n\nSo just relax and take things one after another and enjoy the progress by connecting dots with each other.",

Disadvantage of learning multitasking: you have to master only one at a time and it requires lot of patience.Einstein once quoted: To do multiple things,the only solution is to do one by one.Practically: 1. Start meditation, do it five minutes morning and evening and steadily improve for doing 20 minutes at least.(reduces stress, improves focus and gain high confidence)2. Pick one subject and make it a ritual of studying only for that period of time.3. Be in a process than thinking about results, trust me it will automatically fall into the places.4. Constraints are not your enemy ( you have only 20 mins to read, make that 20 mins work of art.)5. Don't let your thoughts make you believe what you are doing is not right. Have faith on yourself, it is all thoughts game. Master over your thoughts.\n\n~Cheers!",

I've found it very beneficial to \"Lock down\" goals and objectives for the entire year.Spend 2 days thinking of what you want, with a 4 day review period and match them with a list of habits. Then put them somewhere you'll see every day.For instance, I put them on the right hand side of my main Trello Board. Every day, I see there's seven of them and that perhaps playing with this shiny object won't \"move me\" towards their realization.2. The purgatory listTo deal with the shiny object problem, I've come up with a system for reviewing my urges of curiosity.  A \"purgatory\" Trello board for instance, which I review at the end of the week. \"Should I do it?\"  \"Will it move me forward?\"  The answer is typically obvious.  During the week I'm focused on the things at hand, and when I'm done with my week I choose what to do next. Separating the thinking from the doing is always beneficial.3. Systems.Read \"The War of Art\"[1], or \"Daily Rituals\"[2], or listen to any kind of podcast by productive people.  They all say the same thing, losers have inspiration, productive people have systems. Taylor Pearson has the \"Weekly Entrepreneur Review\".[3] I've implemented it. Tweaked it. It's great.4. Information diet.It's good to limit your consumption of information to X amount per day or to specific periods of the day. If you're like me, you love to learn and you want to do it all the time. At some point though, you'll know much more than you can show. Remember \"Show don't tell\", how much do you know that you would not be able to show other people? Probably a lot! Nobody cares that you \"learned X or Y\".  They want you to show that you know those things. Projects, experience, etc.In that case, stick to your goal and do.\n\n[1]: http://www.amazon.ca/The-War-Art-Through-Creative/dp/1936891...

I'm an ENFP personality type (the inspirer) and also have some ADD (have coped well with it as an adult).  I also sometimes smoke weed (which gets me even more excited about the world).Ok, two things that have worked for me.Short term focus:Pomodoro technique.  You work in 25 minute spurts and don't let yourself do anything but work in those 25 minutes.  Aim for 5 or 8 or some number you want to get done that day.  That way, you won't feel bad if you can't necessarily finish something that day, you put your pomodoros in.Long term focus:Google Warrent Buffet's 25 things method.  James Clear did a good article on it.  You write down 25 things you want to do. Then you decide which are top 5.  Then you DON'T touch anything from 6-25.  You have to leave those alone.  They will overextend you and dilute your focus.\n\nSo that's it.  Pomodoro and the 5 things.  That keeps me in line.",

I had an app for this but I found editing todo.txt is faster. Apps like Trello don't have plaintext export. So let's say you finish to-do work for a client, with a text file you can just cut-paste the completed work into Square, Paypal, spreadsheet, whatever the client prefers. I've tried dozens of applications, but none of them will do the work for you ;-) Todo.txt seems antiquated but I found it's easier to make many edits quickly. I indent everything, similar to writing software. This helps me to see the big picture. I have todo.txt on a remote server so all my devices have access to it (no need to \"sync\") also automated backups that I control.",

Four things.  Nothing else.If the topics are roughly of the same difficulty, divide it up in to 5 weeks each, and that's it.  When the time's up, move on.  If you need to, you can move back and forth between the 4 topics for a little variety, but remember context switching does come with a cost.It would probably be helpful to list all the other things you want to do, but can't, as a way of reinforcing to yourself that for the next 5 months, you're not doing those things.  You can pick up on that list afterward... but when you do, make sure you keep up the same discipline: pick a few topics, decide to do them and devote focused time to them, and decide to leave the others on the list and not do them until you've finished with your current working set.\n\nIt's really hard to let go of a lot of things that we want to do and learn.  I experience this pretty often, too, and I'll admit I'm not always good at following the above advice.  But you have to be realistic about the quantity of time you have.

Worth a read - if you haven't already added it to your Amazon wishlist and is not another book in your digital bucket list.My personal solution was to let go. Tech and computers are now the apex predator. Just swim in the ocean, don't resist it. In terms of your path - who am I to judge? I dropped out of a C.S course because tech was moving too fast and the course material was out of sync with how fast tech was moving. Enjoy tech on your own terms.\n\nNote: 'Letting go' also has the paradoxical effect of getting more done with tech. When you get out of your own way, tech works for you, rather than against you.

Now I know I know a lot because I compare with people that does not know what I know every single day of my life. When you really learn something it becomes obvious to you.My recommendation is:1-take notes and computer index anything you learn, with the most important things from a book, talk, whatever, something similar to what Derek does:http://sivers.org/bookWatching again a lecture is nothing bad if you need it. But next time you watch it you can do it in 5 or 10 minutes, focusing on what you need.I extract the audio of every talk I watch and speech recognize it automatically, so I can search for it. I write down the important words of the talk and basic structure.I use open source(vlc, handbrake, command line tools) programs for most of it(everything but speech recognition).2- learn memory tricks,mind maps, and speed reading so you learn faster.\n\n3- Learn to self manage and be happy while working.

Although it's relatively annoying, I find that I have ended up learning and gaining a reasonable understanding of some things (theory of programming languages, parsing and haskell, etc) by stopping for a few months (university takes up a lot of time) and coming back to them. Although when I require some body of knowledge as a requirement to complete a task, I find it far easier to focus and learn a single thing without getting distracted. So for me creating a distinction between what I need to know immediately in my daily life and what I'm learning for fun has been quite helpful in allowing me to focus.

I'm massively torn in all directions, learn for the sake of learning and never have any ideas with whatI want to do with what I learn.HOWEVER... the big difference, and one I have struggled with for years, but more so recently is... \"why bother?\" to do anything. Money no longer motivates. I don't believe in technological progress, I want the world to be different and can't accept it as it is. I want people to be nice to each other, in a utopian way that thinks I can make them happy and doesn't allow for their emotions.. I can't say the thought of anything in the world excites me.I'm overwhelmed by the volume of information, but even more so by the volume of opinions. Take even a simple long-running one, what to believe religiously. I can hear one side, then the other, then another... and each in turn (usually) makes sense. There's not enough info to say one is right, but which is right?? Because each believes their point is right, and yet if I held a different position all would criticise me. I can't resolve that dichotomy.Am I burned out like this chap talks about? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8976685Or is it something deeper like Borderline Personality Disorder?I turned 30 this year, and spending my days wishing I knew what to do with meaning wasn't what I expected to do.\n\n1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9049208",

Put that idealism to use and join up with a cause. You might find it gives you a sense of purpose you're missing.For example, I was bored with engineering and decided to do Teach For America 7 years ago. It turned out to be a very difficult experience, but I feel like I had a meaningful impact. It was also life changing for me in many positive ways.TFA's definitely not for everyone, but perhaps you have an analogous passion you could pursue. You don't have to wait to make your next move until you want to know what you want to do with the rest of your life. Just make a definitive choice, put your all into it for a year or two, and then reevaluate from there.I'm overwhelmed by the volume of information, but even more so by the volume of opinions.

There's not enough info to say one is right, but which is right?? Because each believes their point is right, and yet if I held a different position all would criticise me. I can't resolve that dichotomy.I feel you hear. A couple years back, it occurred to me that we might be in a post-fact society. There's so much data out there that any position can be supported by such-and-such's study or so-and-so's historiography. For me, the answer is to seek principles instead of data. I think there's also a tendency for people to pontificate about things without ever seeing the reality on the ground.\n\nAll the best to you in your decisions. Shoot me an e-mail if you like.",

      "body": "If the \"fun part\" of learning or working on a project is analogous to the climbing of a mountain, you have to acknowledge that there are parts of learning and working that have natural plateaus - you wander in them for a long time and you don't seem to be climbing at all. There are only two ways to consistently get through those spots: by habit, or by obligation.By obligation is the more familiar method for a student: You were told to do your homework and study, now you have to deliver. And then you fear not fulfilling it so you get into a panic at the last minute and scramble to produce the image, if not the reality, of someone who knows what they're doing and learned what they were supposed to learn. Somehow you retain some of that knowledge and so you do become more competent, but you associate the process of getting there with the stressful experience of delivering to a deadline.Doing it by habit means that there is a part of your time in the day where you do some subset of \"important but boring\" things, entirely for yourself. Not because somebody told you to. This is the sane way to learn things and also the only one that you can sustain throughout your life.That is, tomorrow, instead of sitting in your comfort zone at home and watching yet another lecture or skimming yet another blog post, you go out to a coffee shop and you sit there for at least one hour to study \"the doing of work.\" You don't dare get up until you've seen at least a tiny fraction of productivity. Maybe you learned one fact, or you figured out one part of a math problem, or you set up your development environment, or you wrote one important business email. If you accomplish it at the start of the hour, you keep going, you find one more thing to do, and then one more after that, and so on.This feels horrible in the homework mindset, because the goal there is to minimize effort and maximize output, to procrastinate and then rush to get the grade. Here the goal is akin to going to the gym, to practice putting in effort, to get used to the idea of everyday struggle so that you don't fear it. Here, it does not matter how little your output was, if your effort was good. And if you are frustrated with what you are trying to work on, allow yourself multiple options. You shouldn't do only bicep curls every day, and you shouldn't do the same with intellectual work.The homework mindset will creep in and say that this free time should be carved up, rebalanced, and associated with deadlines again, in line with whatever goals and values the parents, teachers, or institutions presently uphold, you should be progressing as fast as the course does, but that is not true. You don't know what is efficient, you don't know what is valuable, and you don't know exactly where you're going in the future. You won't progress exactly as fast as any course, you will breeze through some things and be stuck on others. You will have to try to know. Defer to your own motivations in practicing the doing of work, because sitting there dumbfounded by material you cannot bring yourself to engage with is a good way to crush your spirit and make you feel incapable. This is true even if it should lead to failure within your coursework, as that failure, in tandem with knowing that you were actually practicing and learning things each day, will indicate that you were lying to yourself about what you want and why. That is more important than simply maintaining the image of competence.\n\nTry make sure you are actually as healthy as possible. Maybe you are eating or drinking something that makes you unable to focus, or not enough of something else - experiment, try things. Maybe you need to get out so that when you come back, you're excited about what you're doing. There are many things to try. A well-rounded life needs to try as many of them as possible as early as possible.",

      "body": "Hello,This is the story of my life, man. You can take a look at a piece Peter Drucker (the \"Father of Management\") wrote, for the Harvard Business Review, titled \"Managing Oneself\". Here's an excerpt:\"\"\" We all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre. In those areas a person - and especially a knowledge worker- should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence. And yet most people - especially most teachers and most organizations - concentrate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent person into a star performer. \"\"\"You can also take a look at David Allen's \"Getting Things Done\".I found that the problems you are talking about, for me, have stemmed from poor time management. I didn't know where time went, and I would do/study something, neglecting another thing and then recalling that it's been ages I haven't looked at the darn thing and completely forgot it. So...So it's not visiting something for a while that screws things up. I needed to make sure that I visit everything at least once a week and make it constant. Not ignore it for a year and then try to get back to it.Naturally, you can't do everything daily..I studied Electronics Engineering and I graduated few months ago. I organize my time (think \"Country/State budget\", finite) into 4 axes(think \"Departments\"). I assume it's a 16 hour waking time. Each \"Department\" gets a specific \"budget/time\"Axes/Departments: Engineering (9 hours), Business (3hours), Lifestyle (2hours), Culture(2h).These are the core of who I am/want to be.- Engineering:* Reservoir Engineering/Characterisation (General + specific: NMR, sonic, induction logging, etc).* Electronics Engineering.* Physics (Landau & Lifschitz, Feynman Lectures, Atomic/Nuclear).* Mathematics (Old college courses : Piskounov, Demidovich. New ones: Kolmogorov).* Brush up my rational mechanics (well, basically stuff we did in college in the engineering course).* Signal Processing (Oppenheim, etc).* Programming: (Python, currently building an application). C (for microcontrollers and much more). Erlang (because I want to). In addition to the stuff I'm using. *  - Lifestyle: Fitness, time with family and friends: Because I found out I was neglecting my loved ones in my quest.- Culture/Self improvement:* Short term goal: Fluent in the 6 official U.N languages (3 down, 1 on in progress). Then German.* Learning how to draw and paint, learn to read music and play guitar.* Literature (raised with French literature classics, touched a bit of Russian, keeping that going).* Raised in the military, so I'm interested in weaponery and intelligence.- Business:* Economics 101. * Management. * Business.I divide each day in 16 slots, I have a spreadsheet with colored blocks(each \"axis/department\" has a color)  and make sure I touch everyone of those aspects multiple times a week.So I may skip today's session of something, but I make it up the next day.Many of these may not \"bring\" something or advance my \"career\", but the scope of all of this is a lifetime. For me, it'd be a shame to die being completely clueless in Physics or saying something \"I forgot how we went from Green and Stokes to Ostrogradsky\".. I want to be able to say on my death bed that I died an Engineer.\n\nI'm 27 now, completely ignorant, without talent, but a stubborn motherfucker. It also help I'm addicted to reading and find it satisfying on its own.",

      "body": "I can relate to this. A friend once described me as a vector with infinite magnitude and randomly changing direction. At various points in life I have occupied myself with studying everything from Biology and functional programming to Indian Philosophy and Sanskrit. But I never stick to any one project for long. A few months into my study program, I shift to the next shiny thing that catches my attention.There is a saving grace though: the set of things that I'm interested in remains constant, so that I am not endlessly moving into newer and newer areas, but cycling between a fixed set of subjects. Right now I have come back to functional programming and doing courses from Coursera. I am at the moment quite determined to see this through, but knowing myself as well as I do, I fully expect to jump to something else in a couple of month's time.My current strategy to tackle this syndrome is as follows:* Accept that you are interested in multiple subjects and that you may never be a world-class expert in any of them. However, you can be a competent generalist who has sufficient familiarity with a bunch of fields and this can be valuable. It's also a probably more interesting way to lead your life than specializing in one field.* Keep a journal of your learning activities so that you can learn more about yourself over time. I have been writing every day since 2010 and its fascinating when I look back at what I was doing this time of the year a few years back.* When you start a study project, focus on short sprints instead of the long marathon. Try to accumulate concrete achievements and most importantly, aim for a closure to your sprint. For example, if you start a book, declare victory once you have studied 80% of the chapters. If you start on a Mathematical topic, upload your notes and problems you solve somewhere where you can look them up later, and declare your sprint complete once you have dome some 100-120 non-routine problems.* Realize that your effort is not completely wasted. I first flirted with Haskell in November 2012 but later dropped it and moved on to something else. The next time I took up Haskell again was about a year later in November 2013. I had forgotten most of what I had learned, BUT the second time it was much, much easier to cover the same ground again and I went further in my learning that time. Ditto for Sanskrit. I first tried to learn Sanskrit in August 2013, but later dropped out of my study program. The next time I took it up was in June 2014, and I stuck with it long enough to complete the first part of a correspondence course - a concrete achievement!\n\nI am still struggling with the random-vector syndrome, but I am much better at coping with it. I \"know\" that the solution is to focus on just one thing, but that strikes me as a supremely uninteresting way to lead my life.",

This meant that instead of a curriculum, they found things they enjoyed, created projects from them, then executed. As part of executing, they naturally learned stuff. Worked great.On the other hand I went to a traditional school. That meant I thought of topics in little silos. Want to learn math? Well gee, that could be a full lifetime of study. Everything I look at appears to be infinitely deep.Find projects that you can commit to that involve learning your topics to the depth you would like. Then, instead of the topics, execute on the projects. Doesn't matter if anybody likes your projects or even if you use them -- by getting your head out of the vertical silo and starting to think horizontally, you'll probably learn in a much more natural fashion.\n\nMy two cents.",

      "body": "I've noticed this pattern in people where their ideas are similar to general intimate relationships:● Committing to one means you have to let go of committing to others. So you fear commitment to one.● As soon as you find \"the one\" you become afraid that you'll find another \"better one\" that will make you happier. So you fear commitment to one.● If you're attractive/talented you've got a line of [women/ideas] out the door and around the building wanting to be with you. So you fear commitment to one.● If something goes wrong with a relationship/idea you can abandon it and run off with another instead of fixing and mending the original. So you let go of commitment to one.● I've noticed that men/women who are [attractive, desired, popular] live a \"player\" lifestyle and don't settle down because they don't have to. There are too many options. Then a decade later when they lose muscle, gain weight, lose hair, their options in mates are more limited and they finally settle down.\n\nTLDR: Maybe you're too young, too free, and have too many options, and not ready to settle down to one idea and should instead spend your time exploring and finding out what you're not good at. That way you can limit your options. Sounds strange but it worked for me. Now I have a profitable business and next year I may be able to live off of it entirely.",

You can choose wrong and restart, but you need to go deep on something to get the level of knowledge and experience that will then help you more quickly dive deep on the next thing.As far as that algorithms lecture, it's a case study in learning with a purpose. As an adult, learning something which can then be applied or wrestled with immediately is how you pull value from that lecture. What did you do to reinforce your consumption of the lecture within 72 hours of the lecture? What did you do over the next 12 months?My general advice would be:  1. Identify something you would want to work on even if it wasn't from an engineering standpoint (something that offers the side effect of desire/motivation/focus)2. Discover your strengths and weaknesses in getting things done by wrestling with understanding the problem and practicing solutions3. Learn with a purpose in order to build your skills and experience in analysis, design, and implementation of a solution4. Reflect on what worked or didn't work in steps 1-2-3 for you since everybody is different.\n\nYou may learn differently. You may discover new things about yourself that change how you approach analysis, implementation, etc. You'll have to practice things others mention like timeboxing, task lists, etc.",

Solution (long term): Stop wasting time with BS.Do NOT start to read books / weblogs to solve \"productivity problems\".  Biggest bullshit you could do right now. This will only increase your overload. Not all of these books are bad, but read them later, it will not help you right now. Instead do this:YOUR MISSION (ONE WEEK SPECIAL OPS):-> STOP USING THE COMPUTER FOR ONE WEEK - START RIGHT NOW.No exception. Be absolutely strict about it. It is only one week - it might change your life, so no exception, not one single minute. Send emails now about being offline for one week to most important people. CLOSE ALL BROWSER TABS before shutting down the computer and then put your computer into a wardrobe or in a place you can not see it. Hide it.-> Calm down your neurons.Sleep a lot. DO NOT WATCH TV. Do not read any books. Eat very good, this means healthy, not much. Eat lots of vitamines, fruits, salad, etc., no toxic waste like meat from industrial production (too many hormons and medics), no sugar, no alcohol, no drugs. Spend much time with things that let you feel physically good, e.g. taking a bath, massage, sports, etc. Go outside, walk, move your body, WASTE TIME sitting on some sunny place doing nothing. Do some meditation or just sit down and try not to control your brain, just let your ideas flow like clouds in the sky.-> you will feel better after two days, but DO NOT TOUCH THE COMPUTER AND DO NOT WATCH TV. Do not read books. Go on with relaxing and feeling good. If you start feeling an urge to \"do something\", go out and move your body or ask your girlfriend what she would like to do.-> After the week passed, you will realize that you are still alive and that you did not miss anything. You do not need a computer to have a good life. Interesting experience, try it yourself.-> Now write down what you want to achieve the next week and what exact task you want to accomplish, just a few words are ok, but this will be your plan for the week and you must follow it strictly. Before startig the computer again, write down what exact task you want to solve with it.-> Stop using the internet like a news paper or a tv show. Stop visiting this site. Stop using any social networks, twitter, reddit, imgur, whatever. Only do things you need for accomplishing your task.->  Start using the internet as a place where you can look up things, when you hit a wall and need some specific information.-> Still stop watching TV. It will help a lot. From time to time download some interesting movie or documentary, but absolutely avoid being radiated with an non-controllable unidirectional information stream.\n\nYou are now in a special condition and there is much more to explore about this state of mind, but you have to control your input very strictly. Be aware of the dangers and you will succeed. Good Luck!",

Ranging from the theoretical, say discrete mathematics, to the practical, starting a business.\n\nAll of these different topics, when made accessible immediately and in most cases for free or at a little cost (libraries, MOOCs, youtube videos, books, etc), result in a sort of \"information paralysis\". There's too much to do, too easily, and I end up doing nothing.\n\nThis really got my attention yesterday morning when I was watching an Algorithms lecture, and my girlfriend pointed out that the lecturer looked familiar. That's because I had watched the same lecture 12 months ago and she caught a glimpse then also.\n\nI could have done the course twice over, if I had stuck with it and not gotten distracted. But I didn't, and 12 months later I know nothing more than I did back then about this subject. This scares me.\n\nThis scares me especially because I'm at the start of a 4-5 month stretch where I absolutely need to cover 4 highly technical subjects, on my own and unguided, to continue my studies. (Details omitted for brevity)\n\nI've faced this dilemma before and tried to tackle it on my own, and failed. So I'm posting here in the hops that some other students / professionals have encountered a similar problem and found a solution. It may not be perfect, but it might give me a step in the right direction.\n\nThanks in advance for any comments.\n\nMichael",
