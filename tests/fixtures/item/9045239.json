    "body": "Hi, I need advice about my career direction. I'm going to be very honest about everything, i feel i'm my own enemy here & pretty lost, but i'm sure of one thing that i love learning..\"sorry for the essay\"\n\nI'm college senior, live in NYC.\n\nFor last 4.5 years I've been learning web development. (11th grade upto now). I taught myself photoshop, illustrator, html/css3(by heart), javascript, jquery, less, bootstrap, underscorejs, phonegap, chrome extensions, git, some linux, gruntjs & concepts...encryption, security, caching, scaling.\n\nI'm learning nodejs/express/mongoose & apis\n\nI've made few extensions for chrome but never published them. ( 1. take urls of all tabs open & send them to a mailing list, 2. timer that reminds me to get up & exercise after 20 minutes, 3. list of pre written messages that U can email).\n\nYesterday i started & finished email scrapper for gmail. my brother, a seller on ebay, wanted to personally send email to all his buyers in one go. \nUsing nodejs i made a scrapper that reads all emails, save body in string, extract emails into an array & make .csv file.\n\nBut never did paid work. in ads i see salaries from 30k to 190K for experience 2 to 5 years. Where do i fit?\n\nI don't have portfolio, or contributed to open source, or go to meetups, or resume with dev experience or much experience of anything.\n\nwhy not? i don't know. I've searched for role model/mentor but no, i can't even do that. My most projects don't get completed because only one thing which i couldn't figure out, & could be explained to me by 9 min in person help. \nBut I want to be self supporting adult and get tangible experience.\n\nI've seen comments here like \"i was intern in college & making $xx/hr\" or \"people just know syntax make more than this\".\n\nperhaps share Ur story how U got the job. What i fear is that i get stuck with bad small company that barely cares about its website & pay accordingly. I need to know what to do to get that 80k job.",
