    "body": "Hey everyone - Recently I have been doing a bit at work that if I was doing it at home I would open source it. Working for a corporation has its ups and downs but by far the biggest downer is not being able to give back to the community as much as I would like.\n\nMy question for HN is how do I convince my boss to open source things like wrappers around libs? I do not only have to convince my boss (a software developer) but the CEO (all business) as well.",
