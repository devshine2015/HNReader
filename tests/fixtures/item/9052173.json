Evil, he suggested, was often accompanied by high self-esteem. 'Dangerous people, from playground bullies to warmongering dictators, consist mostly of those who have highly favorable views of themselves,' he wrote.It was an astonishing theory...\"\n\nI can imagine a group of people who might not be astonished; anyone who has been bullied, and then told they should feel sorry for the bullies because the bullies had \"low self-esteem\". At least, when it happened to me, my first thought was \"Low? More like way too high.\"",

And it's mystifying that some critics of the self-esteem movement (such as the author of this article) are as strident in their criticism as they are.The behavior that bullies exhibit isn't caused by high self-esteem, but by their need to overcompensate for low self-esteem through anti-social actions.  They see themselves as inadequate, and they see others as threats.  When people have this self-concept, their fight-or-flight response kicks in.  Bullies gravitate toward their \"fight\" instinct, and social recluses toward their \"flight\" instinct.  People with truly high self-esteem don't see others as threats, so they feel no need to treat them as anything other than equals.\n\nBill Gates and Warren Buffett don't feel the need to talk about how rich they are, or put down people with less money.

But if you look at the bottom, really at the bottom, you’ll find mostly men there, too.” His examples: The homeless; the imprisoned; the people who die at work, 92 percent of whom are male. The popular modern view is that it’s women who are most poorly valued by culture. But, ever the contrarian, Baumeister says men are demonstrably “more expendable than women.”Also this:Susan remembers hearing about a theory that the most successful people in life are those who are still searching for their parents’ unconditional regard.\n\nSound like any famous (recently deceased) CEO?",

There are so many men who are completely unable to find a decent job and nor any wife at all, and on the other end of the spectrum men so rich that one of them has more money/power than a small country. The point that women completely ignore the men on the bottom and fight each other about the men on the top, who in turn have so much choice and so little punishment for bad behaviour that they don't regard women as breathing human beings, seems to add up to a picture that looks quite realistic.It's probably a little too simplified, though. While the percentages vary between top and bottom men and women, you have both on each level. Beside the amount of people one would also need to look at the impact on each gender's life. And the result might still be that a woman on the bottom might have a much harder life than a man, and a woman at the top might not gain as many rewards as a man.\n\nIt's rather hard to get a complete picture, right?",

Feminism seeks to dismantle all of the above, so in that sense, it would make it possible for men to have much stronger support networks.Additionally, many (most?) feminists believe in \"intersectionality\", the belief that sexism, racism, classism, ableism, and heterosexism act in intersecting ways, and that all need to be dismantled together (for instance, this is why most feminists support reform of the US prison system, even though this is something that primarily effects men).

      "body": "I don't have any offhand but let me give you one. The social construction of \"men\" is that men are made (this is in contrast to social construction of women as natural e.g. babymakers.) You have to work to be a man, you don't have innate value. To be a man you compete with other males for resources and reputation. This is the basis of hierarchy, part of male society, the so-called Patriarchy. In competition there are of course losers. They are not men, so much as they are failed men. This is a natural state, there are winners and losers in life. So the theory goes, feminism wants to free men from this destructive social order. This is a feminist theory that explains why there are men on the top and men on the bottom but masculinity is still the underlying principle.\n\nThat is one theory, there are other theories. You can poke holes in this theory, but it's not just a handwave that feminists haven't thought about this or recognized that men are disposable. I mean, feminism knows about this thing called \"war.\" My major problem with feminism is that there is a large gap between theory and activism which results in time and energy being spent on CEO equality and ignoring feminism's own arguments about how mistreated many males are in the lower rungs of society. But that is a problem with practice, not theory.",

      "body": "This sounds very similar to Baumeister's idea. See the Earning Manhood section in his essay. Excerpt below.So perhaps Baumeister's essay wouldn't be a revelation to some feminists. But is Baumeister wrong? Perhaps I am missing the difference. The main difference seems to be the feminist take is more normative.--------http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm\" The phrase “Be a man” is not as common as it once was, but there is still some sense that manhood must be earned. Every adult female is a woman and is entitled to respect as such, but many cultures withhold respect from the males until and unless the lads prove themselves. This is of course tremendously useful for the culture, because it can set the terms by which males earn respect as men, and in that way it can motivate the men to do things that the culture finds productive.Some sociological writings about the male role have emphasized that to be a man, you have to produce more than you consume. That is, men are expected, first, to provide for themselves: If somebody else provides for you, you’re less than a man. Second, the man should create some additional wealth or surplus value so that it can provide for others in addition to himself. These can be his wife and children, or others who depend on him, or his subordinates, or even perhaps just paying taxes that the government can use. Regardless, you’re not a man unless you produce at that level.\n\nAgain, I’m not saying men have it worse than women. There are plenty of problems and disadvantages that cultures put on women. My point is just that cultures find men useful in these very specific ways. Requiring the man to earn respect by producing wealth and value that can support himself and others is one of these. Women do not face this particular challenge or requirement.\"",

But it isn't science. Neither is feminism (in most cases).I'm also amused because of course it is in the women's power to change men's behavior - simply change who they mate with. If they prefer mating with the most powerful men, men will compete to be the most powerful men. It's not the patriarchy creating that, it's women's choices. (Although it's possible that women's choices make biological sense, but I've never seen a feminist who cared much for evolution theory).\n\nAnother interesting thought which I think is from Nassim Taleb: religions did a lot for peace by mandating monogamy and making sure more men got access to a womb that way.",

You had to be special indeed if you were to play into the American Dream, the very only thing holding this mass of people together. Be somebody rather than do something. Not that this would not be in the back of the head of any parent anywhere else in the world, but anywhere else there was an unconscious sense of healthy resignation. Being was still a tad more important than becoming. Anywhere else, the condensate of thousands of dead  generations, the wisdom of finitude had not been washed down to homeopathic levels by the tidal terror and guilt of having left and lost Mother. A borderline Nation, whose sense of abandonment, emptiness and void identity had brought about destruction, oral compensation and the art of fake relationships.

Social groups define social groups dynamically as the group is processing and composing information. Data is almost the same as theory when it comes to psychology.

People have the potential to be more than what language and mathematics can convey, but this makes many people uncomfortable, because it's not definable.

Also named Theory of Science, it studies Science from a philosophical view and brings up questions like \"If we have measured something to be the same 10000 times, can we be sure it will be same the 10001st time?\"What happens when you do that? Well, for me what happens is the realization of the value of being pragmatic. Truth is, like Descartes said, we can't really know anything but our own existence, and depending on your definition of existence, even that can be questioned. But what is the value in that? Now when I know I know nothing, is it a good basis to live my life upon?My answer to that is no, it's not a good basis to stand on. Instead I choose to approach it pragmatically, or as an engineer if you prefer, \"I accept my perception of reality* as real\" and \"a useful fact is information that can somehow be used to predict the future\"But then, I tend to like answers more than questions, I guess it comes included with my engineering degree.\n\n* Not meaning that everything I perceive in a given moment has to be real, rather that my understanding of the world is my best guess of how things are.",

I really do try to create one part of an intelligent dialogue on these forums, but it is incredibly frustrating to have experienced variations of ways of perceiving information, without having the capacity to express the issue in a way that anyone is willing to listen to, and then be down-voted on top of that, which feels like being silenced.> insisting that current lack of knowledge means permanent lack of knowledge.\n\nThe alternative to that is that there is a limit to knowledge, that it is possible for all things to be known. And even if humanity does hit that point, I think at that point, it becomes a choice to choose whether to believe all things are known, or to believe that some things are not yet known.",

But when it comes to social studies real data is very difficult to come by. Self reporting is the antithesis of empiricism. Baumeister does good work, given the field that he works in, and his ideas are powerful and useful. But at the end of the day, it's just a matter of social fashion. People prefer his ideas, or other ideas, or whatever suits them at the time. Anyone can come up with an experiment that shows that one psychological disposition is superior to another, or that kids should be taught this over that. These things change with the times. By comparison, F will always equal ma. There's no way to argue with real science. Everything else, is open to debate.",
