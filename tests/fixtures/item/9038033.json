    "body": "I wish things were always busy. By busy I mean, I'm getting inbound leads, I'm having conversations via email or phone, I'm selling, I'm quoting, I'm fixing stuff on the product.\n\nThen it goes from crazy busy to suddenly quiet.\n\nI just don't know what to do with the down time. I get super uneasy and anxious. I try to do some content marketing but I make so little progress, it's hard to see any result very quickly, so I switch to optimizing the web or landing page and then get see how my PPC campaigns are doing and then reading HN or listening to podcast on bootstrapping etc. I feel inefficient and spread thin.\n\nI feel terrible when things are quiet. I have an urge to start cranking out updates and new features on the product but I stop myself, as I only decided to create features that enough paying users request.\n\nI have a terrible habit of playing counterstrike and checking HN and reddit obsessively until I get a phone call or an email and then I have to do some work. I'm on the computer almost 15 hours a day. Basically, I have no life except on weekends I go out with friends but I'm always ready to answer email or live chat on my phone. Some days I just wait around and end up playing games all day.\n\nWhen I was developing the product it wasn't like this. Nose down, cranking out code, testing, but I'm doing much much less of that now and trying to meet my personal sales target, marketing (based on what little I know), fixing websites, talking to people.\n\nIf you are boostrapping your biz full time what are you doing when you are not talking with leads or busy? Is there anything else I should be doing? Am I going about this the wrong way? Really would love your inputs, especially if you are unemployed and you rely on your bootstrap business.",
