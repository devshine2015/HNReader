I'd rather use the word \"upkeep\" here.Financial systems is one of those things we do because as human beings, we're handicapped in terms of coordinating with each other. We depend on external feedback loops to do anything as a big group. Perhaps if we were smarter, we could all just agree to do things for common benefit. But we're not that smart, and hence we need an economy. Maintaining it takes energy, but it should be seen as civilization upkeep costs - something we have to pay, but would do well to reduce as much as possible. It's a trade-off between amount of energy we use and the utility we get from it, and so it's fair to call unneccessary energy expenditure a waste.The reason people call Bitcoin a waste of energy is that because it makes it clear how ridiculous the whole thing is - you're literally throwing away useful resources to generate abstract numbers that exist solely because we suck at coordinating with each other. In case of traditional banking the energy expenditure is hidden under many layers of indirection (the mentioned AC costs, for example), so it's not that obvious to people.The other problem with Bitcoin is that resource usage is - as far as I understand the mechanics of that cryptocurrency - locked in a zero-sum game. You need to throw more and more electricity away just to keep up with other people doing exactly the same thing. This is the worst case of waste imaginable - because you can scale up your energy use ad infinitum without any marginal benefit. That's why also political campaign and advertising is mostly waste - everyone's effort just goes to cancel out the effort of everyone elses.\n\nWe'd do well as a civilization to reduce our upkeep to the minimum required.",

      "body": "OK, let's go with it. Apart from the fact that people are happily paying for the energy bitcoin is using (so if people want something it is not wasted). Let's try to take this idea seriously.The task is not to have some spreadsheet with transactions that you could have of course on the oldest computers. The task is to provide a global payment system that people trust.So obviously we're not going to use RPi. We need some solid machine. No problem, best server is cheap for the global payment system.Well we also need reliability. So at least a few of these machines.Real reliability, so actually they must be in some separate geographical locations.At this point there are already some problems with consensus but they can be solved since we control the whole system. Cool.But what if one location is compromised? We have to care about that, our global payment system must not be destroyed by servers being compromised in any way.So first, we need some really good software security. Solvable, it can be open source, maybe people who depend on it will review it. Then we need hardware security. Security at these locations must be really good. It's global so we might actually want to be able to protect ourselves from some country's army - that bumps cost of these facilities a bit. Actually, a bit too much. We want to be independent from governments. They have a lot of money, it's really hard to protect physical locations.Then there's the trust problem. Who runs it? Some organization I assume that have some cut of the cost of the whole operation. I won't even dive into details here. Throughout human history there probably was not a single organization that could be trusted, objective and rational once it gained enough power.And to make it complete, unrelated to your comment, some people are mentioning proof of stake. Apart from the fact that it doesn't seem to provide any provable security, you have a trust problem again. Proof of stake is based on the assumption that most holders (in terms of money) want bright future for the currency. I wouldn't assume that. I'm happy that it is completely irrelevant for me who is Satoshi and what is she going to do with her coins.And then, there's initial distribution problem...I don't really see any more efficient solution to what Bitcoin currently provides. It is of course probable that such solution will appear in the future, but the network effect is huge. It's really first time in history we have such kind of money and Patrick Byrne (overstock CEO) explains it nicely in some of his talks. So even if such technology appears, I think it will get implemented in what is currently called Bitcoin (sidechains seem to be some baby steps of that).\n\n(OK, I got a bit of topic, but these WASD keyboards are such a pleasure to type on.)",

      "body": "> Creating Bitcoins is a side effect of processing transactions.I don't think that's a particularly useful characterisation of the situation. It makes it seem like some kind of \"processing\" on the transactions is where the real computationally expensive work occurs, with a side-effect of creating bitcoins.In reality, mining is pure mathematical busywork. A miner spends time trying to find a valid block (a valid hash with enough zeros at the start, as determined by the current difficulty level). This is a mathematical task unrelated to any \"processing\" of transactions, and is independent of the number of transactions or their complexity.While the miner is performing this busywork (trying hash after hash waiting for a valid one to come up) a number of transactions are occurring and are flying around the network. The miner is noticing these and caching them up. Eventually, if the miner should \"find\" a valid block, he publishes it to the network, and crams into it all his cached up transactions.So creating bitcoins isn't really a side-effect of processing transactions, per se. Rather, both the approval of transactions and the creation of bitcoins are side-effects of running a mathematical algorithm (mining).As such I probably wouldn't usually describe transactions as being \"processed\" at all (which would tend to imply computation related to the transactions themselves), but that they get \"included\" into a mined block.>I don't know how many transactions are currently processed when one Bitcoin is generatedhttps://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-per-blockThat graph shows the number of transactions per block over time. You could then divide by the block reward to find transactions-mined-per-bitcoin-generated figure.>Power consumption per transaction will probably always stay pretty low. Because one way or another the users of Bitcoin have to pay for them. And they won't use it, if it is expensive.\n\nWell the mining \"difficulty\" level (which essentially dictates how much power is needed on average to find a block) is controlled by rules programmed into the bitcoin system, in such a way that the higher the total mining power contributing to the network, the higher the difficulty (adjusted every 2016 blocks, so that the entire mining network on average discovers a block every 10 minutes). Here is a graph of how difficulty has evolved over time, as the aggregate mining power has ebbed and flowed https://blockchain.info/charts/difficulty",

Or is the argument that they would have been more successful with fiat money? For that matter, how would the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and Incans been enabled by fiat money when the accumulated wealth of those empires effectively gave Spain the ability to mint its own commodity money?\n\nIn \"Debt: The First 5, 000 Years\", David Graeber makes a convincing argument that the introduction of commodity money helped the king raise larger armies. The king pays soldiers in gold or silver, then requires people to pay taxes in the same. Otherwise the soldiers, who are effectively strangers, don't have access to the credit economy of small communities.",
