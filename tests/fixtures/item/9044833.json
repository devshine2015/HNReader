    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've been given a $2K budget from my employer to spend on training, books and/or conferences. I currently do Web Development (mostly front-end) and was looking for suggestions on what to spend it on.\n\nMy long-term goal is to work for Microsoft or Google and wanted to learn more about the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures. But I wouldn't mind to learn more about whats coming around the corner in the world of front-end development since things are changing and advancing so fast.\n\nThanks in advance!",
