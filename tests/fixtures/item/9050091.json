(Currently an Infrastructure Engineer at a startup, enjoying that position very much because of the rate at which I am learning).\n\nDoes anyone know of projects/companies that are seeking people interested in economics and CS, or of people who hold positions where they use knowledge in both of these areas?\n\nDoes anyone else also enjoy econ and CS above all other subjects? (Like a lot of people on HN, I have a variety of interests, but these two trump them all).",
