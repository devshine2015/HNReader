    "body": "I would have commented directly on the posts, but the YC startup job postings don't allow comments.\n\nI see job postings for a couple of startups here and they are offering approximately between $60k and $110k and 0.5-1% equity for what appear to be significant positions - mobile or full stack developers, director of marketing, etc.\n\nIs this really the going rate? If so, my mind is boggled. I was under the impression there is competition for great employees in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere in NYC, if I wanted to be very competitive to hire into any vital position with rare skills, I would anticipate a floor on pay of $125k. I don't care if that's a designer or a developer or a marketer or what ... I just mean anyone working full time who has a good head on their shoulders and some rare skills.\n\nAnd 0.5-1% equity wouldn't move the needle much. I mean, if you have a 5 person company and you bring someone in and give them 1% equity, what is their equity relative to the person sitting next to them? IMHO It's a joke. Their ownership is purely symbolic, in a relative sense, and it's a symbol of how little they own relative to a founder.\n\nAm I completely insane? I would love to understand the logic here, I am not so much criticizing as trying to know more about the dynamic and the industry culture/standards.",
