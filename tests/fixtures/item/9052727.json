      "body": "My experience with equity:$20K into a startup, which was sold to midrangeSoftwareCompany, which was in turn sold to Oracle. Wound up with 17 shares of Oracle, worth about $2000 at the time.Another experience: $2K of \"hell, I'm leaving so why not buy the shares I vested in\". Eight years later the company is wildly successful (public and valued at $1B). I call them up, and my shares are worthless through some stock shenanigans.A third: $5K investment turned into $21K. Yay. I guess I almost broke even on the Silly Valley slot machine.Lastly: I did much, MUCH better with options and other stock-related stuff at a couple of large companies, spread out over 16 years. It's not unreasonable to make a few million on these in the course of your career.Get a good salary. Don't trade a good salary for equity, because in general it's a bad deal and you're just going to get screwed.\n\nIf you're good and you take a low salary for the \"developer class\" equity that I've seen, take a hard look and see if you're getting anything else worthwhile (an education in technologies you wouldn't be using otherwise, good contacts, a possibility you'd be identified as a principal \"must have\" in an acquisition, with incentives to match, etc). Otherwise you're being taken advantage of.",

If it seems to you that it's got a lot of value, try to get more (ways to get more include being awesome and asking). If you think it's not worth much on two consecutive bi-annual reviews, see if there's another place where you could get a better deal.\n\nIt's no one's job to manage your career but yours.",

      "body": "Equity in the form of options is usually worthless. Even in the off chance that the company is wildly successful, your options will only be meaningful if you got them early enough to have a ton of them or a ridiculously low strike price. I've worked places where the total number of options offered to new employees (vesting over 5 years) were fewer than what the early employees and founders vested (and exercised) WEEKLY.RSUs tend to be better because, unless your company goes out of business, they're usually at least worth _something_ when they finally vest. One thing about stock, however, is that after they're all vested, you're effectively seeing a decrease in your overall compensation. An RSU package that fully vests after 4 years incentivizes you to start looking for a new job after 4 years.When I get an offer that contains options, I usually mentally value it at $0 and THEN consider whether the salary still seems competitive.EDIT: I generally value _options_ at zero.\n\nI also LOVE kasey_junk's strategy below of asking companies what they'd hypothetically offer in cash instead of equity. That's pretty much guaranteed to make the company get real about how they value their equity. I remember once negotiating ~$5K more in base salary to \"give up\" what OMG COULD TURN INTO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OPTIONS!!!! The company eventually went bust and sold for pennies on the dollar.",

It did bring throughput.As of about a month ago I was let go as the top developer in the Saas company because I was deemed too expensive by the board. I am pretty sure the CTO didn't want to give up me as a resource.All of a sudden I have realized that overseas developers have become a priority and it is my feeling that as an hourly developer my days are limited in making $80-$100/hr (corp 2 corp contract).It is my feeling that I have 2 possible directions.  1) Start an outsourced overseas development company and use my 'Software Architect\" title (which is so funny to me because architect is thrown around so much in software) and manage resources overseas.  2) Start selling software on a per usage basis or in some value add model. I believe both of them are solid bets however #2 takes more commitment.\n\nAt this point I think the reason salaries are topping off is because of the global market.

      "body": "Based on personal experience and observation of some startups around here this is the dynamic that I've seen and what could be happening:- startup gets some funding, but not a lot, and needs (more) developers- startup founders think they can find good developers at rates that are similar to those of 'regular' developers outside the Silicon Valley / HN bubble / web development scene. Possibly because these founders are non-technical and mostly have experience in bigger, more 'boring' companies where developers aren't 'essential' (or don't seem to be), or groomed inside the company and happy with lower salaries.- startup finds out that nobody will take the jobs at the offered salaries- startup decides to be more creative and - if they're very lucky - find:    1. competent, usually remote developers who are willing to work for much less than the going rate in home country       2. oblivious developers or developers just out of college who have no clue how much they can make  Unfortunately, what I suspect often happens is that they end up hiring subpar developers who just want to get paid an acceptable salary and know nothing about their potential value in their field, or developers who are under-qualified for the specific challenges that many startups face (web-based, mobile apps, rapid development, need for independence and taking initiative because it's chaotic).And the founders of these companies, if they're not technical, might never quite realize that in the end they're probably wasting more money because the codebase is terrible.While I would never argue that the only competent developers are those in the 'SV/HN/web bubble', I do think it makes sense that there's a correlation between developers who are oblivious to their value and the rest of their field, and developers who are still stuck in older, less efficient approaches to many startup's problems.\n\nPay your developers well!",

I would rewrite the whole thing in either Backbone or some variation on the react/flux approach in, at most, two days, and be able to get the in-house developer up to speed in another one to two days if they were capable and, perhaps more importantly, willing and remotely curious.In part this has been due to the current speed of development in browser technologies and frameworks/libraries, and in part it's just part of working with in-house developers who have no love for their job or have other things that they prioritize (35+ with kids, understandable!).Usually this level of horror only presented itself in older, more established companies with 'legacy devs', but I've seen similar issues with (web) startups that hired without knowledge of the domain.\n\nSo, to be clear: getting the job done is the priority. I've worked on Backbone projects where I would've loved to use the latest and greatest, but happily worked with stuff that I would consider, in front-end-hacker-news-hipster terms, old-fashioned. And I've come to realize that if you have clever developers with curiosity, you can get a 'front-end app' done that isn't pretty, but works well. But too often, especially in the 'cheaper' startups with little founder-level technical know-how of the domain (front-end), I've seen things go very, very wrong.",

I believe it often comes down the the fact that they have grown headcount relatively slowly at the same time market rates for competent developers have risen quickly.The veteran engineers from the company's earlier days are often true-believers in the company/product, and probably joined for below-market at a time when market rates were lower.  As a result the comp structure at these companies gets into a really weird state where a new market-rate junior hire cost about as much or more than the seasoned technical staff they already have on payroll.\n\nThat's a tough pill for companies to swallow, and even if you do manage to hire you'll have a mutiny on your hands if you don't do something quickly to close the 40+% gap between the comp your existing employees are getting and the market.",

For senior positions in the Bay Area doing web development and such, I see salaries in the $140-$175 area, with most being around $140-$160k. Actually, these numbers haven't really changed in the past four years or so, which makes the discussions about salary inflation puzzling to me. I'm sure you can get more at Google and such, but these are the typical offers and ranges I've seen at various companies, most of them startups of some sort. NYC should be on par. There might be more companies that don't want to go as high, but there will be plenty of companies that do in both cities.There is no shortage of tech workers, but companies seem to have trouble finding qualified ones anyway. What puzzles me about this, is why a company would refuse to hire someone they really want because of salary, yet settle for someone that they're not that impressed with simply to save $10k or so a year.\n\nEDIT: Note that I ignored the equity completely in this case as it's really irrelevant (generally worth nothing).",

The eco-system has not regained its trust and the mythos of worthless equity persists.\n\nYour point about \"what is that compared to the person next to you\" reflects this: you're thinking about equity relative to others as important, vs. the odds that 1% turns into various amounts of money. YC companies get soft landings/acquihires at a high rate and also often become worth a lot. 1% equity in a YC company you believe in is equity worth having. (key words: you believe in).",

Since you're working for a startup, your salary might very well be much less than $25k/yr of what you're normally worth at other companies.  Aggressively negotiating your salary at a non-startup company can get you that much and then some.So it's about whether you believe the company will make a >$10M exit, knowing that most companies die and many exit for $10M or less.It's also about other factors.  For example, whether you get paid depends on liquidation preferences, and how much you get paid depends on dilution and taxes.\n\nAlso cost of living.  I've heard that decent apartments in SF can go for $3k.  (Zillow seems to confirm that many apartments are around $3k.)  Compared to a $1,500 apartment in a place with reasonable cost of living, that's an extra $18k/yr that you'll need to pay just to live there.

A nitwit co-worker who had 50x his equity in the original incarnation that died and who had nothing to do with its resurrection and its eventual purchase got ~$20M on the basis of having a 3-letter title in that original startup.

Recent grads aren't usually as effective as people with experience, and salaries tend to reflect that. I can see many reasons why a founder might be interested in hiring someone with little to no experience, but the job postings didn't specifically say \"junior\" in them.\n\n- I see many comments referencing the realities of what is affordable. Yet some of these startups are advertising more than one job opening. Therefore, it would appear they are considering hiring three people instead of one person for 3x the salary. My question is informed by real world experience and written material: advice, essays and quotes including obvious and much repeated ones by Paul Graham, Peter Thiel, and Bill Gates which emphasize the concept that great employees are magnitudes more effective than good ones. Every knowledge-industry employer I've talked to agrees. Much startup advice emphasizes how bad it is to grow your team too quickly, and how a low performing employee hurts far more than a high performing employee helps. Given some of the companies are hiring for multiple positions, this could imply the salaries are considered competitive, and paying more wouldn't get a better employee.",

Often you don't find out later until 3-6 months into a working relationship. I think you're placing a lot of weight on the initial offer because many smart companies will issue huge stock grants and salary bumps for their best employees to retain them.

It's been several years since I've seen a salary that is competitive with freelancing, but if a company had a published plan about performance-based raises and could point to some happy employees who could verify that theory aligns with practice, I'd be more willing to consider their offer. Conventional wisdom is the opposite: the only way to get a decent raise is to leave.

The reality is, most companies do this. And as a company gets larger, they get this down to a science. The calculus here is pretty simple because the company (whether you're a startup or Google) is very incentivized to retain it's top-tier talent who can go and work anywhere they want.No company will promise you millions of dollars in long-term incentivized compensation (whether that's a stock option or a RSU) because it's highly dependent on the output of the individual and circumstance. I do think you can safely assume this is happening all around you (like I said: I meet many people who we cannot get) but they may not be publicizing it on forums like HackerNews (I am not sure many people find it kosher to boast that they made a lot of money as opposed to people who have been burned).To be constructive though, I think prospective employees could ask the following set of questions to figure this out:- Are there people in your company that are making above $X dollars a year in total compensation (options + salary)? I'd like to know what's possible if I worked hard and made a huge contribution.- If I worked very hard and killed it, what kind of total compensation could I expect down the road? How is it split between long-term incentives like options and salary?- What's an example of a project that someone did an amazing job on that changed the trajectory of the company? Was this rewarded? (Does the company have projects that they valued and has acknowledged that it made a difference?)- How long has the most tenured Engineer in the company been at the company? What about the 2nd most tenured? 3rd? (This can tell you if the company has talent at the company they believe is top-tier and if they value them presumably because they are incentivized to stay)\n\nI am sure there are other questions you could ask but these were just the ones at the top of my head that I feel would be pretty convincing.",

People that need a chance.I mean, no judgement; those people need jobs, too.   And sometimes, sometimes you can find someone really good in one of those categories.

Ask for more money, in a non-confrontational way.  Leave out the \"or I leave\" bit.\n\nRegardless of the answer, spend some time interviewing around.

I got into a pre series A startup for 90k a year (on a W9 rather than a W2 so -20% after taxes and computing no vacation or sick days) + .1% equity per month to make an iPhone app.  I had two co-workers who were sub par.  They left the company.  I'm currently taking over the rest of the programming (backend/web stuff).The system I'm inheriting is pretty bad.  Security holes, bad EC2 setup and the web front end is unmaintainable.I can handle the work but the time required to fix everything is significant and I feel underpaid.  I got promoted to VP of engineering but my pay and amount of stock I get didn't increase.We're in the middle of raising series A.  We are strapped for cash until series A is completed.I'm meeting with my CEO soon and would like to talk about a significant pay increase as well as more equity.  I don't want to seem like a jerk and say I want at least $175k per year as well as .2% equity per month now or i'm gone since we're in the middle of raising series A and I'm the only programmer.  I also don't want to keep kicking the can down the road.How do I go about asking for fair compensation?  How much money and equity would you guys ask for?  Anyone have any ideas like get 120k now and after series A raise it up to 175k?\n\nLittle more about myself.  Came from a top 15 CS program, placed in a couple programming competitions, was part of a company that previously exited as a back end dev, been programming for 17 years and I'd I've been at start-ups since I graduated in 2007.",

In that case you can just let your supervisor know you need that rate to stay on board.If you are dealing with the CEO or person approving the raise and you feel the need to justify yourself I would keep it short and simple like \"In order for me to move forward in this position my salary has to be at $175K\". There really isn't much else to say. Just like 50 Cent - you must to be able to walk away - and that is your power. You 100% should ask for the raise or leave. Don't get caught up with letting OPP affect you. OPP = Other peoples problems. For example the CEO is a f#ck up for a large variety of reasons so he gets you believing they are in the middle of \"raising series A\" or whatever else bullshit that you have no control over therefore has nothing to do with you. It's all about you mo fo. His problem is actually more like he is \"in the middle of raising series A and is about to lose a top developer who knows the code base\". Don't worry if the CEO is worth his weight he will solve that problem.\n\nCatch my drift? You only live once my friend - DO NOT LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE.",

An employees risk is several magnitudes less than the founders across many factors. That said, some of the first employees get shafted on equity/pay and I think that is worth addressing, but again it is based on market rates.

      "body": "I often see people refer to employee/founder risk as a reason for for employee's getting less stock in the early days, but I think this is the wrong way to think about it. As an employee or a founder, your risk in working at a startup is very low. Both of you experience some degree of opportunity cost, but you're mostly \"risking\" the possibility of having to go work at a significantly higher base salary with more benefits, perks, and possibly the same expected value in terms of stock. So, what gives?The answer is that we don't pay people based on risk. Fire fighters truly have a high risk job, yet they typically earn less than many skilled white collar jobs. Rightly or wrongly, we pay people roughly according to their economic output, and probably not even their fully captured economic output (see: teachers).The reason people use this risk language when it comes to startups is because there's a place where there _is_ some economic risk being experienced, and these people talk about \"de-risking\" the business all the time: investors. Investors are risking capital, typically all of it, for the chance of an outsized return. As a company de-risks, meaning as it becomes more of an actual business vs a business model search engine, the return an investor might expect for their money is naturally reduced (from 100X to 10X to 2-3X over the course of funding a 'typical' SV startup).Founders often put capital into a business as well, in the form of maxed out credit cards, deferred salary, and sometimes actual bootstrap $$$. Their monetary contribution is typically quite a bit smaller than an investor's, though, so why do they get such a huge share of the ownership? Again, it comes down to economic value. A founder is producing a huge amount of economic value simply by taking an idea and turning it into a real thing that people can evaluate, invest in, work for, etc. An employee isn't creating nearly as much value, although I think it's pretty obvious that the first employee at a YC startup is probably creating more than %.01 of the value in the company so an offer like that isn't fair.\n\nI do find it fascinating that so much of the investment language of risk gets used when speaking about employees. I think some of this is just lazy thinking, but it's also partly psychological -- you want employees to feel like investors vs having them feel like contractors, for instance. And honestly, if a company gets really big, an employee with 1% stake in a company is still filthy rich, even if the guy he had beer with the whole way is now going to Davos on his private jet.",

      "body": "I don't think that's the case. It is appropriate to think and speak in terms of risk for employees. Consider the contrary case: self employment. I don't mean founders here, but freelancers, consultants, bootstrappers etc. They really are paid by the amount of value they produce, or as close to it as we can determine via the market. Success as a freelancer depends on being able to produce a large amount of value and being able to capture as much of it as possible. There's an incredible range here, from getting $0.03 to do human-OCR on Mechanical Turk to Hillary-Clinton-style $300,000 speaking engagements. It's highly variable over time as well. Freelancers are constantly looking for new clients, and badgering existing clients to actually pay them. They also have to be prepared to have dry-spells where they're not earning at all. In other words, it's risky.Given that backdrop, the value that employers offer to employees is reduction of risk. Employees are not exposed to the downside risks of the market, nor do they participate in the upside when the business does well. Employees do risk losing their job, but that risk is generally pretty low.Startups, though, offer less risk reduction than more established companies. Some of this is intentional, to align incentives and select for employees comfortable with the big-risk-big-reward reality of a startup. Some of it comes from the inherent instability of startups. Chances that a startup employee will abruptly lose her job, or not get paid for work already done is much higher employees of established companies. Even the \"big reward\" scenarios tend toward instability—for example, \"Good news, we being acquired by Google! Now we all have to move to Mountain View.\"\n\nBecause of this, evaluating a job offer from a startup has to involve an assessment of the risk it involves. A portion of compensation is usually equity, and that equity is of completely unknown value, compared to say, RSUs as Facebook. The job being offered is inherently temporary, since the company will either fail, be acquired or transform into a completely different company within a few years. It's less risk than freelancing, but much more risk than working at a big company.",

Many companies who get reported are banned from using the service. And to help combat this specific problem, I've recently (in the last month) made our job posting form much more explicit about our rules around compensation and recruiters.Your suggestion that we accept reviews from candidates and employees is a good one -- it's on our to-do list for the next quarter. I think it'll go a long way towards solving this problem.We can't catch every job or every bad actor -- there are about 17,000 active listings on the site right now, with many more posted each day. But we're working to improve the experience for both sides, and we rely both on algorithms and reports from users like you to make that happen.I'd really like to hear more about your specific situation. If you care to share, ping me at dave@angel.co -- I'm based in NYC and have a vested interest in making sure our marketplace operates well here.Thanks for your time and for bringing this to our attention.\n\n[1] angel.co/help/talent#rules",

Tax advantages, the 13.8% employer's payroll tax is avoided by be being employed as a contractor and taking your income as a dividend.2. Tech career ladders are pretty specific to the tech industry and London just doesn't have the medium and large tech companies you see in Silicon Valley. So you hit the ceiling pretty fast and in order to be valued for your skills you pretty much have to become a contractor. This is not so different to working in tech in a non-tech organisation in the US.3. The National Health Service means you and your family are not reliant on your employer for health insurance. Individual health insurance is super expensive in the USA. Most people I know who contract in the US have health insurance through their spouse's employer.\n\nI ended up moving to CA because of the career opportunities. I'd probably be better off contracting in the finance world in London, but most of that work just isn't very interesting.",

Once permie, you're basically guaranteed employment unless your company goes broke.Compare that to the contractor. There is virtually no overhead for the company. They claim VAT, and expense your rate. And it's very easy to get rid of you, or hire you. A company can ramp up and ramp down as the need arises for new projects - which has a lot of appeal.\n\nIt's interesting for me coming from the U.S.. I think it's largely a result of the regulation.

      "body": "Throwaway for obvious reasons, though you might figure out who I am if you know me personally.For early stage startups, I was being told 100k + 1% was standard in NYC. This was by several places, or you could just go look at AngelList where they often explicitly list it.I ended up getting rejected by tons of NYC late-stage startups (Percolate, Recombine, Betterment, YCharts, Digital Ocean, SquareSpace, Airtime), and I'm 90% sure that compensation expectations were a big reason, since I usually got past the tech screen but things broke down once we started talking compensation. I also got knocked out by some tech screens because they are crapshoots, and when I do 15 code screens I'm bound to make a few mistakes.The market is in a weird spot, tons of companies desperately want engineers but they are freaked out by how fast salaries are climbing. They really don't want to go into bidding wars over people, and they really don't want to give new hires more then current hires and then be forced to give their entire engineering staff raises. Based on some conversations, I think they actually expect salaries to go back down but I think they are delusional, I hear an incredible amount of companies that are planning on ramping up hiring. Now granted if I could reliably predict macroeconomic trends I wouldn't need to work for someone else, so I'm just guessing. I do think there might be an \"app\"/\"big data\" bubble but there are so many traditional businesses ramping up on software hiring for things like ecommerce, logistics, and operations.Companies will say they can't find talent and will pay whatever (i.e. pg), but it's bullshit, cost is still an enormous factor and they are working hard to keep it down via information asymmetry, bait-and-switch tactics (had several companies tell me one number on Hired and then go significantly lower in person), immigration lobbying, etc. De Blasio just signed some \"tech talent pipeline\" thing, which is pretty ridiculous given how many places rejected me.If talent was really short, they wouldn't make people with 8 years of experience and a portfolio explain the difference between a linked list and array over the phone, they would be upfront about salary numbers (and actually show up with that number rather than one that was 10k lower) etc etc.There is a ton of VC money out there and a lot of companies still think it's 2009 and they can get people cheap, a lot of average engineers are now VP of Engineering at some random startup with no team, and still thinking they can fill out that team with people making less than them. In reality, you have to pay me _more_ to take a lower role, not less like they expect.Also this is unrelated to salary but I got rejected by tons of places for seemingly no reason, when it's not compensation expectations I think it's a general sense of elitism and \"we have a high bar\", \"we need false negatives\". It's idiotic to do that then complain you can't find people but they all do, I think they take a sick pride in rejecting people and feeling selective, even if it hurts them. I'm pretty sure if you are a qualified heart surgeon, most places looking for heart surgeons will hire you, but if you are a qualified engineer you go through an insane interview process and no matter how good you are, 70% of the time you get rejected for some bullshit false negative reason. Feel incredibly lucky I snagged that Google offer.There is not tech talent shortage, it's 100% about cost. Meanwhile, in-house counsel with comparable experience can easily swing 160k base, the VCs and the CEOs pay themselves well, etc etc. They still view engineers as rank-and-file bitches who are at the bottom of the totem pole and whose salary must be kept low.\n\n/rant",

Venture companies are supposed to be taking big risks, but it's a big deal to have a \"best practices\" based sales form? Sounds like when my big enterprise CIO looks for validation from Gartner, etc for any decision making.\n\nI worked at a late stage startup in the dotbomb days and walked away with a decent equity position that based on the \"best practices\" discussed today would have been somewhere between 75-90% lower. If you look at total lifetime compensation, my decision to work for the government is financially much smarter than one of these startups. Salary is the midpoint between startup and a bank, but benefits are very rich. Add in the future value of pension & benefits, and it is a bad deal to leave unless I was a co-founder.",

When I expressed interest in Product (even though I was interviewing for an engineering role), other companies told me that engineers are not involved in product decisions, Google told me the opposite and had a few interviews questions where we talked about product.

      "body": "Not comfortable sharing specific numbers, but check out Glassdoor for a range. The key to Google offers is realizing the value of target bonuses and restricted stock units. Typically a startup will offer you Common Incentive Stock Options. When they vest, you have to buy the shares out of pocket and pay capital gains on the difference in valuation, even though you have no means of selling them unless the company exits. The company can also exit via a sale, in which case if the sale is too low common stockholders get screwed (and they might do it intentionally to screw over ex-employees and grant retention bonuses to current employees instead). The reason for this is because \"investors are putting up money\" and therefore deserve preferred stock, even though they are asking you to take a significant salary cut for those common stock and that salary cut represents a far bigger portion of your income than the investment represents the VC's portfolio. Look up Liquidation Preference for more information on this.Google gives you restricted stock units which you can sell immediately upon vesting (or hold onto one of the hottest stocks of the last decade). No need to pay any money out of pocket and risk getting burned, you can only make money.As far as the Google interview, there is a massive amount of information about it which the Google recruiter will provide, but check out Glassdoor interview questions, Cracking the Coding Interview, and Steve Yegge's \"Get that job at Google\" post.Linked-lists/trees are absolutely fundamental data structures so of course you should know them. Every single engineering interview at Google _requires_ a coding question, so yes there was whiteboard coding in every interview. I would highly recommend buying a whiteboard and practicing at home because things like space management and hand-writing matter.\n\nA lot of the industry has copied the Google interview one way or the other so you might as well study for it even if you don't get the job.",

Huge caveat: you know all the details and I only go by a post on the Internet, so I'm likely to be wrong.The tone of your messages make you sound a little bit demanding, or difficult to work with. You may have voiced strong opinions during those interviews. When you say that a startup will make you come back several times, it's a sign that they like you, but have a concern that they are trying to figure out. My guess (again, just a wild guess), is that you were technically very strong, but had possibly a bit of an attitude. That would explain the startups behavior. The main two reasons a startup would hesitate to hire a good engineer is either they are asking for too much money, or the candidate seems inflexible.\n\nAgain, I'm likely to be completely off.",

They're looking for serfs, not collaborators.When I interview a senior dev, I deliberately test to see if they will contradict/debate me on something technical. If they won't, they're not really senior or they're just yes-men who won't call out my mistakes and make the organization better.\n\nEverybody talks a big game about giving employees responsibility and autonomy, but many lack the guts to follow through and hire smart people who have actual spines and opinions.",

Companies like Google will pay $100k more than what typical startups will pay for quality senior engineers as far as I can tell, and that too is even a bit of a bargain.

So it's not interesting why YC companies are offering salaries like that, rather its more interesting to wonder why they are willing to accept the developers salaries like that filter for.The developers who would accept those salaries either are a) worth less than the median salary b) don't know their value in the industry c) are naive about the true value of the equity part of the compensation or d) are happy to not maximize their earnings.All of those filters seem to bias towards inexperienced developers without others who rely on their income (ie young developers from relatively financially stable backgrounds) or those who have no other choices.So that seems to imply one or more of the following:- software is the first craft ever where experience does not improve performance.- writing good software is not important.- neither is long term team cohesion, as that is very difficult to maintain in the face of chronic underpayment.\n\nSo the most likely thing this implies, is that the successes YC companies are shooting for on not predicated on writing long term sustainable good software.  Again, there is nothing wrong with that.  But I worry that when that isn't explicit it  has negative ramifications in environments where writing good software is important for success.  If people confuse success as a YC company with success at writing good software they may take the wrong lessons away.",

The problem is that for this sum, they're not going to attract the kind of candidates that know about that, know what the position should actually be, and who will realign the company in a sensible direction. They're going to end up with an entry level candidate who delivers what's asked for without knowing what's needed, and the world will have one more mediocre product to show for it.",

With PPP, the cost of a developer now becomes just attracting and onboarding them. What are the chances a given project will succeed? They are less than 30%. So, the expected value of this strategy vs paying for the developer is positive, especially if you don't have the $ to spend on all kinds of projects and see what works.So you can certainly justify it for projects that you wouldn't have otherwise undertaken. The projects that you have to develop for sure, are another story. And then there is everything in between. This is just a great way to structure those deals fairly and align incentives instead of trying to optimize your own share. If the project fails, then you lost nothing. If the project succeeds -- and the developer is more incentivized that it will -- then you get a partner with whom you are both interested in increasing the revenue.We've done it with our apps and have been happy with the results. It works especially well with startups without a huge budget, but a platform and technology that can be used by many people. We've actually open sourced our platform, and in the future plan to do an entire accelerator program around this concept. In our situation we have a few more things:* We have a clause that if the developer leaves and we spend X amount (at our discretion) on the app, then 30% of X is coming out of the money due to them, with the proviso that they won't ever get less than 10% in any given month. And of course they get 30% only if they launch version 1.0 of the product, and complete all the deliverables.\n\n* We have a quarter million monthly active users, so the developer is interested in working with us vs stealing our idea and going solo. Because if they launch through us and we handle all the QA, production, launch etc. then we can get their app a big userbase from day 1. They are as happy as we are to give 30% to Apple for taking care of all the sales, fulfillment, credit card processing etc.",

I agree with other people here that you shouldn't take a pay cut for equity, but don't be surprised when you see lots of job postings around $100k.\n\nAlso consider that there are a lot of startups that raise 6 figure seed rounds and under $10 mil Series A that you don't hear about, compared to the (mostly over) hyped startups that raise millions in seed and tens of millions in Series A. They literally can't afford to pay people enormous salaries.",

The question is: is there a market for this thing?  Why pay more than you have to just to get the MVP out the door?  This isn't cynical, this is how it works.Once the product is proven, then you can bring in a second group of people to take it from V1 -> V2.

Many people without the math background end up writing n^3 solutions to O(n) problems in code that gets executed at high frequency.   The core  value of those math skills isn't their explicit use, it's the training the brain gets in writing efficient algorithms and having knowledge of how hard certain problems are.  Even in CRUD apps I've often seen requirements that are equivalent to NP-hard problems on large data sets, and I've been able to discuss the efficiency tradeoffs allowing the business team to redesign features when they weren't happy with performance.  Without the math background, we'd see build it, put it in production and when the data gets large enough cry about performance and lose users waiting forever for a page to load.\n\nThe last piece is in many start-ups I've seen the programming team will own or co-own Analytics because of a lack of statistics skills on the business team.

      "body": "There are a number of details to understand that explain the salary / equity.The first thing is the range. More jr. candidates are on the lower end of both salary and equity. Yet relatively close to market rates. More sr. candidates are on the higher end of range and usually have to decide if they value equity or salary more, for the final compensation package.The second thing is the type of start ups that offer this level of compensation: early stage / seed-funded. These are not Uber, AirBnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, etc. especially given that many companies that post on HN are graduates of YC, these guys have their first major investment to work with post-demo day. They aren't working with $25-50-100 million. They have $1-2 million to make the most out of. This limits the ability to pay market rate. Yet allows for engineers to be on the ground floor of a potentially a huge opportunity (or not).Third thing is the equity...and a bit of a reality check. The founders came up with an idea, worked on it for quite a while, with $0 salary, applied to and got into YC, raised (in all absolutes) a large amount of money (you try getting someone to give you $1 million), gave up some of the equity for that funding, and you want what, 10%? 20%? What sounds fair? Unless you're the first engineer, with a background of leadership that will make you qualified to lead the growing team, 1% is extremely fair. If the company is truly successful, you're looking to make over $1 million. Even if you're underpaid by $50k, that's 20-years worth of difference, which you'll see in under 5 years. Of course there's no guarantee, but that's business.The other question to ask is are you getting options or RSUs - huge difference.And finally, the low salaries are typically brought up to market rate after series A (the first big round). This round is usually raised with 0-2 years of the seed round. So you take a risk of $50Kx2 and stand to make $50x20.\n\nThat doesn't sound that crazy.",

Even if you're underpaid by $50k, that's 20-years worth of difference, which you'll see in under 5 years.You can't evaluate the \"equity\" part of compensation like that. The chances of that happening are very low, and you're most likely to get diluted further. E.g. the chances of >$100M exit are 10% (which is a huge overestimate), it takes 5 years, and you get diluted 50% (so you end up with 0.5% of the company): you get $1M, which is $200K per year, with a probability of 10%, so the expected value is $20K. Sure, the exit might be an order (or two) of magnitude higher, but the chances of that happening drop even more rapidly.\n\nOf course, you might be risk-loving, accept the equity not for the expected value, but for the variance, but then again, I don't think it's (usually) worth it.",

Forgone salary is just dollars, same as the money the VCs put in, and just as useful to the company.

      "body": "(Bearing in mind this is not from the Valley POV, but I recognize a lot of the same dynamics here in Singapore)Psychologically:The founder is stuck between a rock and a hard place. With limited cash to work with (seed rounds are tiny here), that extra 10-20% could translate into 10x that in revenue if used on say, Google ads instead of your salary. On the other hand, equity is also scarce; the founder has just given up 6+ months of his life and career and taken enormous risks to start the business, it's starting to take off at last (hence the hiring ads), he got some funding closed after months of negotiation, so he considers that his equity stake was \"earned\" and a newcomer \"series A/B employee\", even at early stage, should go earn theirs as well. There's often not much equity left anyway, not enough for control even after a seed round, so founders often don't have that much to give up.More cynically, this often leads amongst less technical founders and management to the \"let's hire young, cheap guys, they work harder too, these experienced guys have ridiculous expectations\". I've stopped counting the number of times I heard that (sitting on the management side, advising other companies, etc.). Just last quarter, it was a major angel investor who told my client in his advisory meeting \"you should get some unpaid interns from universities to do QA, and offer the best ones a paid internship\". Just last week, a colleague who wants to start his own thing refused my offer to introduce him to experienced engineers I've enjoyed working with, because he'd rather \"go for cheap people who'll work for free initially\".(As an aside, this fear is misplaced. I know of at least two CTOs who worked for \"free\" for 3-6 months until either revenue or funding happened; the second was in his 40s and had 3 kids...)The investors are a significant source of pressure. Not to say they all do this, but a lot of the more \"MBA\" types consider headcount a KPI to be optimized, so they push you subtly or overtly to reduce salary, hire cheaper people, negotiate harder, and so on. Think of it as reducing the cost of buying out of the money options (from their point of view). One HNWI who I once considered a friend stopped talking to me after I pitched him an idea, he offered me seed funding on the condition I take no salary until revenue, and I declined (having better options). For some reason, that made him very angry... It's considered a key business skill amongst those people to get \"cheap\" talent and a failure of your management skills if you do not. This is even more the case when your choice of tech stack and management style encourages wild growth in the engineering department (think Rocket Internet companies with dev teams in the hundreds) and where that 25-50% discount on market rate translates in quite substantial savings.Finally, both from investors and founders, comes the idea of \"hedging\". Why don't a lot of startups use Haskell or Lisps? Not because they can't find talent (there's plenty) but because it's a lot harder negotiating with a Haskeller with 10 years experience and a PhD, even with the \"Haskell discount\" priced in (they will take less money to work in a more interesting stack) than with a fresh grad from a local university with some basic understanding of RoR or Django and hopes they will become the next Zuckerberg. This makes the latter a lot more replaceable, and investors don't want their companies hostage to the tech talent.\n\nThe rest is really stuff that is somewhat right. It IS nicer psychologically for certain personalities (mine included) to have more responsibility, less bureaucracy, a friendly and slightly hipster work environment, a younger set of colleagues full of hope and energy, and a fast feedback loop (it's easy to become indispensable and add a lot of value everywhere in a startup). It IS somewhat true that you will gain experience - if only seeing what not to do - that will be very valuable once you start your own thing, and that spending a couple years on a reduced salary hopping a couple of 10-100 employee startup jobs can be a better use of your time as a future founder than doing AI research at Google.",

Building a company require resources.  I have to eat and pay rent.  But my company, without resources, can't pay me, even if I'm 100% of its labor pool, being a solo founder/CEO (on the startup I'm referring to - there's another I'm involved with with a cofounder);No salary.  Why can't I just write a SMALL check to myself, why do I need either investment or sales to do this?  Can't the money just NOT have to come from somewhere?  This is rather unfair, I hope people here will agree.The only way I see out is building massive value.  Unlike your example, where you get 1% while having a six-figure salary and chance to learn to do it all and become a millionaire on your own next, I am not even earning 5 figures.how is this fair?  Maybe I shouldn't be doing a startuuuuuuu  -oh, I see what your problem is :) :) :)</s>Seriously.  Why do you want to work for a startup if you don't want to end up with 1% of a $100M company, while receiving six figures for the privilege (i.e. someone is paying you, six figures, to play the lottery; and being highly technical and having direct effect in your role, you both have asymmetric information and can build the lotterys' RNG yourself, e.g. by building the best product on the market and protecting that status.)  Finally you get to learn everything it takes to found your own startup and receive funding later.there are a million BigCorp's that compete without regard for startup aignment or risk/reward.  what makes you want to work for a startup anyway, given what you've described?  Wouldn't you be a better match for Microsoft or Google?\n\nhonest questions here and a perspective from the other side - someone with a large founding appetite rather than salary requirement.",

Me saying I should keep more of the wealth I create is \"whining\" according to you.  I guess the parasite heirs who suck off my labor and their toady advocates like you must hold the moral high ground then.  You're the one who needs some perspective, parasite.",

People in this thread are throwing around salaries that amount to more than any doctor, lawyer, or politician makes in most major world cities. A lot of people in here need a reality check, comparing their 'profession' of front end jQuery to what a doctor does - I can't believe the person above made that remark. You're all worth what the market will pay, yes, but have some humility please. We all know we're in a bubble here, no need to get a big head about it and act like 100K+ is your god given right to what amounts to one of the least capable, accountable, and professionally trained careers in the developed world. Pipe down, nobody in the late 90's bubble talked like this.",

If so, my mind is boggled. I was under the impression there is competition for great employees in Silicon Valley.\n\nHere in NYC, if I wanted to be very competitive to hire into any vital position with rare skills, I would anticipate a floor on pay of $125k. I don't care if that's a designer or a developer or a marketer or what ... I just mean anyone working full time who has a good head on their shoulders and some rare skills.\n\nAnd 0.5-1% equity wouldn't move the needle much. I mean, if you have a 5 person company and you bring someone in and give them 1% equity, what is their equity relative to the person sitting next to them? IMHO It's a joke. Their ownership is purely symbolic, in a relative sense, and it's a symbol of how little they own relative to a founder.\n\nAm I completely insane? I would love to understand the logic here, I am not so much criticizing as trying to know more about the dynamic and the industry culture/standards.",
