You can forward different external ports to the same internal ports on apps (e.g. port 31245 -> port 22 on your Ubuntu app). You can also launch VPN server and then ssh to your servers from inside your virtual LAN :-)Web traffic is handled by the Portal system, so port 80 and 443 are \"intercepted\" by default. They proxy HTTP traffic to your apps based on the paths that you specify. You can forward /blog to one WordPress instance and /otherblog to another WordPress instance.3. The compute power levels are meant to be relative to standard usage, but benchmarks are probably better for hackers, so we'll do that.4. Thank you!\n\nGreat feedback, thank you!",

Real world apps store data on the separate \"user data\" drive that is attached to all app VMs, which makes them upgradeable. And they almost always have a web interface for the user to interact with.They can also use the Portal metadata service to interact with the system. But for the most part apps just receive raw TCP/IP traffic or proxied HTTP traffic and work normally.We began working on Portal before Sandstorm was public, but I can tell you this is the first time I've been happy to see other people working on the same idea as myself.

I'll reply to your email, but the answer is definitely yes!I've created a number of SaaS services over the years and the pain of building a scaleable service shouldn't have to be repeated by every single app developer. It's a huge distraction from building a great app.\n\nIt shouldn't take much work to get Known running as a one-click auto-upgrading app, but I look forward to your feedback on the process. Thanks!",

But that doesn't help regular people and it doesn't solve the problem of renting a server from a trustworthy host.The biggest issue is lock in, not proprietary vs open source. It's okay that Facebook is proprietary, but we don't think it's right that you can't switch from Facebook to a new social network, without losing most of your data. They create intentionally broken data exporting systems to keep people locked in. They can only do this because they hold all of the data we've given them.With Portal users control all of the data themselves, so they can give it to any new app they want to use. And they can even export their entire Portal environment and take it to another provider entirely.\n\nThanks for the feedback!",
