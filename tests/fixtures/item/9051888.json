I'm suren are probably mortified at yourself already and I'm just piling on, I don't want to end this post implying drunk driving is consequence-less. It's not.",

I mean the typical hiring scenario is sending a CV, doing an interview, signing a contract, start working.  Though maybe larger firms will do a background check depending on the industry.\n\nBut I don't think a misdemeanor means anything.",

I'd hate to end up in a situation where I accept a new job and then end up with an offer rescinded because of this!\n\nIt's amazing how one really bad week can follow you for the rest of your life. I am grateful nobody was hurt and it wasn't serious (in my defense, the car was parked in my parking lot at the time)",
