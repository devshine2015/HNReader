    "body": "Last year, I ushered in my mid-thirties with a personal crisis culminating in a first offense, misdemeanor DUI. How much is this going to impact my career?\n\nI'm a software engineer with a reasonably good resume, advanced degree from a well known school and I'm highly productive.\n\nI know every job I apply for in the future is going to have a checkbox about misdemeanors on the application. How much do I need to fear it?\n\nHas anyone had experience with applying for software jobs with a record?",
