I never, ever press the \"Like\" button on anyone's site; if I want to share a page on Facebook, I post its link on my wall.\n\nThis is largely because I do not want to be tracked, and that I am working hard to defeat analytics.  I regard both web and mobile analytics as profound invasions of my privacy.\n\nI don't have any problem at all with Medium or anyone else analyzing their own web server logs.  What I don't want is for any one site to correllate my activities, with my activities at other sites.\n\nI would be quite an active contributor to Medium discussions if I could register directly with Medium, without associating my Medium accounts with any other sites.",
