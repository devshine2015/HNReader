This would be similar to having every combination of words show up in your search results as a blank page on Wikipedia that you can edit to add content. When I use Google to find content, I want to find actual content, not ten billion placeholders: if the site doesn't have information on a particular phone number it should return a 404, not a 200, and not be indexed; there should then be a way to submit information into the database (actual information, not something totally useless like \"reported\") that then creates that URL. From the home page (which hopefully at this point has high page rank for being a non-spammy resource) they then should link to a list of \"updates\", which will be seen to change often, and the links on the other end of those will also change often, so Google will pick up new content quickly and efficiently. Yes: I realize that these websites are trying to rely on the search query as their discovery tool to get people to add content, and so doing this \"harms\" them, but if every one of them does this it becomes a useless discovery tool anyway (as the page of results is just pages and pages of these placeholders); imagine if every wiki did this: chaos.",

Almost all of your pages probably have no contentYou've got 1.9M+ calls. Some numbers like 2145627653 have multiple calls but none of them provide anything new. Others like 4802550681 have 1 or more calls but no information other than city + state which is available on like every phone now. Others have no calls, no information at all.2. As a result, almost all search users probably bounce, immediatelyPeople want to know who is calling them, right now. They have like 6 seconds before the caller hangs up so they need to know - when they realize there is no information they are going to bail. They are also going to be pissed off that the top result on Google is asking them for information rather than giving it to them.3. Your traffic is probably almost exclusively from searchAgain I'm guessing here but I can't imagine that you are getting more than 5-10% of your traffic from sources outside of people searching for information on a phone number. That says to me that people don't think there is a reason to come back.Yeah, you were first, but who cares? Your site sat around pissing off search engine users (including me) for a decade and still looks like the MVP it was in 2006. You may not be actively spamming the web but your website is passively spamming Google. Those other guys might be worse but who cares? That doesn't change the other facts and their punishment will likely come soon. That argument doesn't get you off the hook with Google.\n\nIf you want to get back on top you're going to need a better offering than effectively being the first result on Google and a comments system.",

If the problem is that the caller ID name with date of call is not rich enough data for Google, then I can limit the sitemap to only pages with textual comments. But Google is not saying that, or that they will reinclude it if I do that. They're not saying anything except that the site is using illicit practices.Prior to Google removing whocalled.us, it accounted for 68% of traffic. 15% was direct, 6% Yahoo, 4.6% Bing.

Plus the site code is old, and people tend to dislike it when you mess with how their site works.So I made whocalld.us as a place to write a new interface from scratch that uses the same database. That is where I added fulltext indexing for search. Previously the search box on whocalled.us used Google Site Search. But I want to remove Google services, so rather than add fulltext search to whocalled.us, I pointed it to whocalld.us for now.I figured if I could rewrite the site to be better, then people would allow me to replace whocalled.us with that one.I thought maybe that's why Googlebot detected whocalled.us as spam, if it saw duplicate text on whocalld.us. But I tried things like denying Googlebot access to whocalld.us with robots.txt, and setting noindex in meta tags, but nothing helped. If that were the issue then a person could see I own both sites during the reconsideration request, and either remove the \"Pure Spam\" penalty or provide some clue as to how I should fix it. Besides, if that was enough to get my site removed, then what's stopping malicious people from doing the same to other sites?Either way, I should have the freedom to fork my own website to recode it if I want without having to worry about the Google police. I don't build websites for Google, so if this is how things work, I'll have to find a way to thrive on the web without Google's help. We did it before, and we can do it again.\n\nThe other domain, whocalld.us, is also deleted as \"Pure Spam\" too.",

      "body": "Essentially, this is the way that Google sets the standard for acceptable web content.It's subjective, it's vague, and sometimes unfair but that's the burden they have to bear. Defining the \"quality\" of a web page for a search has become as important a factor to web search as any other.But \"search quality\" is a leaky abstraction like any other. When someone looks up a random phone number that just called them, they aren't looking for a blog post about it. They're looking for a very small amount of information.Let's imagine we're determining the quality of a web page as a search result. Say we're looking for the combatants of the Second Boer War, so our query is \"second boer war combatants\". Now, if we had a page that listed only and exactly the names of those combatants, that would seem to be the \"answer\" we're looking for. But wait, isn't it better to see a page about the Second Boer War which has a lot of other information about the conflict? Or a page about the military history of the most notable combatant? Or even a table of major historical conflicts with their combatants?Basically, although it would seem like a precise \"answer page\" is the best, there are a lot of other factors. The most popular kind of search results are often Wikipedia pages, so people seem to want that level of information on a subject. People sometimes search for something as a way to get to something else. The nature of the web indicates that pages with links to further information are more useful than those without them. And of course, as untrustworthy sites proliferate, the more well-compiled, organized and correlated information is on a page, the more reliable it is.So ultimately, I feel like it's inevitable. As search has improved, Google has to make these kind of choices, in a quantifiable way, about the nature of a quality search result. And that ends up, in the tools-make-us stage of the web we're in, shaping the envelope of what web content is popular, even in some way acceptable. In turn, the web becomes easier for Google users to use by becoming easier for Google to index and search effectively.\n\nBut this is the more painful reality, as I also know. You get pushed out of the Google results not by sites with better information, not by sites that are more relevant, but by sites which seem like they can play the \"Google game\" better because they have the resources and profit motive to put together good metrics for the myriad signals that make you rise in the ranks.",

There were scripts for people to utilize in their VoIP boxes, and it was a good honest site.\n\nGoogle has been trying to weed out telephone spam in their results, and for some reason they deleted the original instead of the useless empty shell sites that spam every possible telephone number combination.\n\nIf I search \"whocalled.us\" on Google now I see #1 the Google+ page for the site, and #2 a WordPress spam page. They deleted whocalled.us with a \"Pure Spam\" manual action, and literally replaced it with pure spam.\n\nwhocalled.us has never used spam tactics. That is why copycats quickly beat it in terms of traffic. The first competitor used spammy SEO techniques, and is often the #1 result now for telephone number searches.\n\nI've been making websites since before Google existed, and it feels like my ways are going extinct. Prior to this \"Pure Spam\" removal, there was a partial action for unnatural links. I was shocked that a search engine sent me a notice that my website would be penalized unless I contacted other websites to have them remove links to my site. Remove links? That is the whole point of the web!\n\nIt included some suggestions of \"spam\" sites with links to mine, and when I clicked one I saw someone's personal blog with some links to their favorite sites. I don't know what world this is, where a search engine tells a webmaster they need to contact a small-time blog owner to have them remove a link recommending your site, but it's not mine.\n\nTo me this is still the World Wide Web, where little guys like me can play on the same field as global giants.
