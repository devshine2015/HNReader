    "body": "BuildZoom is looking for a talented engineer to help us tackle the $600 billion home improvement and construction industry.\n\nFor too long, this market has been plagued by information asymmetry but we're working hard to fix that.\n\nWe have built a huge dataset that nobody has ever had access to before: 70 million building permits (and growing) and licensing information for almost every licensed contractor in the United States.\n\nWe are using these data to do things like:\n\n1. Identify the best (and worst) contractors are based on work history and other signals\n\n2. Let people see who built their favorite homes, restaurants, and offices, and the remodeling history of their own home\n\n3. Create brand new insights - e.g. we're analyzing publicly traded builders to forecast next quarter’s revenues (this actually works!)\n\nTo learn more about some of the things you’d be working on, check out these links:\n\nwww.buildzoom.com/newsfeed/san-francisco-ca (beta) -- map of remodeling projects in SF\n\nwww.buildzoom.com/charts (beta) -- analysis of remodeling projects around U.S.\n\nblog.buildzoom.com/san-francisco-remodeling-activity\n\nBuildZoom is built in Ruby on Rails, but we are open to applicants without Rails experience as well as to incorporating new technologies into our stack.\n\nWe have around 30,000 daily users so you'll be helping a lot of people.\n\nWe are still a small team. The office environment is fun, productive, and a great place to learn and work. Our office is at 1st street and Folsom in San Francisco - you can see how it looks here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgaYLiw6bvo\n\nBuildZoom has raised $4M from great investors including Formation 8 (Joe Lonsdale), Darren Bechtel, Sam Altman, and Y Combinator.\n\nDrop us a line if you're interested in learning more by e-mailing founders@buildzoom.com",
