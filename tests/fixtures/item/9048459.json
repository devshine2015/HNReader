    "body": "I take care of logistic at www.spoil.co at YCW15 company and wanted the input of HN on our biggest hurdle at the moment.\n\nWe run a personalize gift box service. This means that all our boxes need at least 3 different items in them that are all personalized to the description we have of the recipient.\n\nExperienced purchasing professional select items we currently hold as inventory and purchase any missing items to make each gift unique if needed.\n\nNow that system is very time consuming but also highly risky since we hold various types of inventory and would constantly need more in curated to an even more specific level if we didn't want to buy at full price.\n\nWould HN have any item on how to grow our network of suppliers without having to hold on to some inventory and manage complexe shipping logistics?\n\nOur skills is in software and  we feel like we aren't investing our time at the right place to be efficient and with high growth in sale the problem gets bigger and bigger each day...\n\nThanks for your tips,\nCharles",
