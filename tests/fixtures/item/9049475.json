    "body": "Hey folks!\n\nSo I have a new Startup that makes it easier for people to find the right venue for their event. It could be for your wedding, cocktail party, get-together, business conference etc... The development of the application is 90% complete, and I'm not in search of a viable business model. One option one would be to charge companies/venues a subscription fee i.e $8/mo to be on the website but I would probably have to show a monthly user/viewer-count, which doesn't exist yet. Another option, is to charge them per-lead.\n\nI could certainly use some help here - open to all ideas! Doesn't matter how wacky, outhere they are.\n\nThanks!",
