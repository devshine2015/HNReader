    "body": "It has been a long time since i used stackoverflow / serverfault for a question, it used to be great.\n\nMy last 2 questions cost me reputation points (disincentives) and got unanswered ( i even deleted a question and went googling / experimenting for it the next 5 hours, i also spend a heck of a time before asking on Stackoverflow...).\n\nNone the less, is there any alternative for stackoverflow? There has been so much rules there i didn't notice the last year (or something), that it doesn't feel like a community anymore. More like editing a page on Wikipedia, that doesn't get accepted.",
