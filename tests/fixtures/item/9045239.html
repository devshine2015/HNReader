I&#x27;m going to be very honest about everything, i feel i&#x27;m my own enemy here &amp; pretty lost, but i&#x27;m sure of one thing that i love learning..&quot;sorry for the essay&quot;<p>I&#x27;m college senior, live in NYC.<p>For last 4.5 years I&#x27;ve been learning web development. (11th grade upto now). I taught myself photoshop, illustrator, html&#x2F;css3(by heart), javascript, jquery, less, bootstrap, underscorejs, phonegap, chrome extensions, git, some linux, gruntjs &amp; concepts...encryption, security, caching, scaling.<p>I&#x27;m learning nodejs&#x2F;express&#x2F;mongoose &amp; apis<p>I&#x27;ve made few extensions for chrome but never published them. ( 1. take urls of all tabs open &amp; send them to a mailing list, 2. timer that reminds me to get up &amp; exercise after 20 minutes, 3. list of pre written messages that U can email).<p>Yesterday i started &amp; finished email scrapper for gmail. my brother, a seller on ebay, wanted to personally send email to all his buyers in one go. 
Using nodejs i made a scrapper that reads all emails, save body in string, extract emails into an array &amp; make .csv file.<p>But never did paid work. in ads i see salaries from 30k to 190K for experience 2 to 5 years. Where do i fit?<p>I don&#x27;t have portfolio, or contributed to open source, or go to meetups, or resume with dev experience or much experience of anything.<p>why not? i don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve searched for role model&#x2F;mentor but no, i can&#x27;t even do that. My most projects don&#x27;t get completed because only one thing which i couldn&#x27;t figure out, &amp; could be explained to me by 9 min in person help. 
But I want to be self supporting adult and get tangible experience.<p>I&#x27;ve seen comments here like &quot;i was intern in college &amp; making $xx&#x2F;hr&quot; or &quot;people just know syntax make more than this&quot;.<p>perhaps share Ur story how U got the job. What i fear is that i get stuck with bad small company that barely cares about its website &amp; pay accordingly.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Honestly, it&#x27;s up to you, but you have to begin somewhere even if it means at a low pay small company that doesn&#x27;t care about &quot;its website &amp; pay.&quot; The skills you will learn working in a team&#x2F;work environment is invaluable. The goal is to first get your foot in the door which ever way you can. Establish yourself, build some reputation and credibility. This is real experience, the kind that will eventually get you to the job you desire.<p>Always remember, no matter how good you think you are, there are other people out there that are better than you. You&#x27;ve had 4.5 yrs of self taught experience? When I was your age I&#x27;ve already had over 10. It was never above me to take that $50k job or that sketchy Craigslist posting that netted me just $500 for weeks of work.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9045689&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9045239">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9047109" href="vote?for=9047109&amp;dir=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9045239"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9047109"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=techsin">techsin</a> <a href="item?id=9047109">1 day ago</a> <span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Why not all three? If you&#x27;e not fully employed, you have the freedom to pick an choose.<p>I&#x27;d try to land an internship first. The benefits of actually having a 9-5 job will help you &quot;level up&quot; to future employers. Sometimes there is stigma with being just a contractor&#x2F;freelancer, and you&#x27;ll never learn how to work in a team. When you&#x27;re doing all the work, you&#x27;d never know what it&#x27;d like to work with designers, product managers, project managers, etc. These are all invaluable skills and skills&#x2F;experience that you don&#x27;t have and will never be able to learn until you get a &quot;real&quot; job. The other benefit is, you will be able to learn on the job. You&#x27;ll be getting paid to learn, so what&#x27;s not to like?<p>If you need extra money, do some local freelancing. I wouldn&#x27;t try to tackle anything too big because most freelancing jobs suck due to unreasonable client expectations. You&#x27;ll need to be a unicorn. (Not to be confused with consultation).<p>And always find time to work on your own project. This is not negotiable.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">First, work on typing more professionally. I received my first paid programming position while I was still in high school working for a collection agency handling data. At the time I was very excited and they informed me that I got the position for a few reasons. First, I was relatively inexpensive. Second, I was very professional in my interview and my resume was light weight but highly polished. Third, I had some of the technical skills they needed, but they felt that with my professionalism and my work ethic I would be able to complete the work. They were right, I did well and I moved on from there.<p>So, for you, I will go down this list. First, set your salary expectation according to your experience. Have you had other, non-technical positions before? If so, get ready to leverage them appropriately. If not, get ready for a very low salary for your first position. It is highly unlikely you will make $80k on your first position.<p>Second, work on your professionalism. &quot;U&quot; is not a word. &quot;i&quot;, the first-person pronoun we all know and love, should be capitalized. You need to watch your punctuation. You don&#x27;t need to be perfect, but work on your writing and presentation skills. How you present yourself really does matter.<p>Where you should be perfect, or as close as possible, is in your resume. Make sure it is polished. Make sure it presents you well. When you go in for interviews look your best. Lately in our business there is an attitude that everyone can come in looking like they are hung over after a long night of coding followed by partying, dressed like a skater, and often riding on a skateboard. You can look like this as long as you have skills to back that image up. If you are really Junior, and you are, you better look like the type of guy who is going to show up on time and get his act together to get some work done.<p>Third, be ready to show off and discuss your technical skills and most importantly, how you are going to acquire more. They are taking a risk on hiring you. There is a cost to hiring, training, and letting a developer work on your code. You need to show you will provide more value then you take back. From what you write above, I think you will have no problem showing your value.<p>Finally, getting a job, any job, is a numbers game. Apply to 20 different positions. You will interview at a bunch and you will get the one job you are looking for. After that, learn all you can and then feel free to move on when the time, and your skills, are right. Good luck!</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9045561&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9045239">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9047051" href="vote?for=9047051&amp;dir=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9045239"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9047051"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=techsin">techsin</a> <a href="item?id=9047051">1 day ago</a> <span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The industry needs more people like you, passionate and eager to learn.<p>Start networking. You never know who you might meet. You have a better chance at landing your first job through an acquaintance as opposed to answering a help wanted ad.<p>Start attending meetups, now. My top recommendation would be OpenHack <a href="http://openhack.github.io/new_york/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;openhack.github.io&#x2F;new_york&#x2F;</a> While you don&#x27;t have a portfolio of projects on a website, you most likely still have them on your computer. OpenHack may be good place to showcase what you&#x27;re working on if someone shows interest. Those projects also come in handy for when you start landing interviews. I always took a computer to job interviews to showcase what I was working on and even did some live coding. There&#x27;s also another advantage to doing it this way: You are in control of the interview and I feel it&#x27;s a much better approach than sitting through a Q &amp; A with a hiring team. It says, &quot;I came prepared.&quot;<p>For your first job, don&#x27;t undercut yourself on salary. At least make enough to live. Even if you find a company is horrible, you can still leave yourself open to other options. You might even land your next job, doubling your salary, through someone you worked with and recently left said horrible company. It may take your 2-3 employers to get to your desired salary.<p>I landed my first job through a random conversation with a neighbor (before that I was college dropout and an office temp for two months trying to land said job). It paid $28k and half of my month&#x27;s pay went to cover rent for a studio apartment. I ate PB&amp;J and an apple every day for lunch. The job was copying text from Word documents and PDFs, marking them up with HTML. At the time, the company was building a hosting subsidiary. 2-3 nights a week, I spent 3-4 hours volunteering my time with that effort, through which I picked up Linux. I landed my second job through a previous co-worker. Every job offer I&#x27;ve ever taken started with an acquaintance.<p>My recommendation is to pick an area&#x2F;skill set and focus on building that out. Looking at what you listed, I&#x27;d most likely recommend JavaScript for you. Take a look at a front end JS framework like Angular, Backbone, Knockout, or React. Maybe even try all of them out. Eventually, you might have questions. As you do, Open Hack might be a great place to get help and pick up a few pointers. As you become familiar with JavaScript, look to expand your horizons with a JS backend technology like NodeJS and look at exploring frameworks&#x2F;platforms like Meteor, DerbyJS, or Express.<p>If you do decide to go the JavaScript route, here are some resources to get you started.<p><a href="http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsbooks.revolunet.com&#x2F;</a><p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/contents.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;eloquentjavascript.net&#x2F;1st_edition&#x2F;contents.html</a><p><a href="http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bonsaiden.github.io&#x2F;JavaScript-Garden&#x2F;</a><p><a href="http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.addyosmani.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;essentialjsdesignpattern...</a><p>JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford<p>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninga by John Resig<p>JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov<p>As a side note, some of the most brilliant people I&#x27;ve worked with didn&#x27;t have CS degrees (Music, History, English, etc). Their key strength was that they were passionate about what they were doing and were constantly learning.<p>“Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.”
