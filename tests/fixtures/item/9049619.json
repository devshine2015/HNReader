    "body": "This is Jon from Pimoroni. We're a UK hardware start-up that grew from the popularity of our Pibow case for Raspberry Pi. We manufacture all of our products in our workshop in Sheffield, UK.\n\nOver the past year we've really started to set out our stall in the digital Maker world with hobbyist electronics accessories and 28 days ago we launched our biggest project: Flotilla.\n\nFlotilla is a range of smart, friendly, and affordable modules which you connect together to create amazing projects which sense and react to the world around them. Designed to take away the fear and uncertainty from experimenting with the amazing sensors and devices that are available these days.\n\nWith a focus on plug and play we've blended smart widgets and even smarter software to make Flotilla friendly for everyone; from complete beginners to savvy Makers.\n\nWe chose to launch on Kickstarter as it's a great platform to tell the full story and helps us gauge demand for our first full production run.\n\nYou can find out more on our Kickstarter here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimoroni/flotilla-for-raspberry-pi-making-for-everyone\n\nI'll be around to answer any questions. We have posted some public updates that approach some of technical choices we made - they are worth a read if you're interested! :-)",
